    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" This query is seeking information about specific movies that include or portray the character named \"Popeye Doyle.\" The core request is to identify or list films, which are media entities, and associate them with a particular character. The question is not focused on a single piece of information but rather on retrieving a set of related items, indicating a search for specific objects or concepts in the domain of film and entertainment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format would likely involve a list of film titles, a description of the films, or a set of facts about which movies feature the character. For example, the response might include names like \"The French Connection\" or other films where Popeye Doyle appears. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description. Instead, it anticipates a response that identifies or references specific entities (films) and their relationship to the character. This suggests an answer format that is informative but not purely descriptive, numeric, or location-based.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"films,\" \"featured,\" and \"character Popeye Doyle.\" \"Films\" refers to specific objects or concepts in the context of cinema. \"Featured\" implies association or inclusion, indicating a search for entities that contain or relate to the character. \"Character Popeye Doyle\" is a proper noun that denotes a specific entity, likely a fictional character from media. These terms point to a query about identifying particular things (films) that are connected to a given concept (character), which aligns with the definition of an \"entity\" category. There are no indicators of human focus, description, numeric data, location, or abbreviation in the question.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking about specific objects, concepts, or things in the context of film and media. The term \"films\" refers to tangible or conceptual entities (e.g., movies as cultural artifacts), and \"character Popeye Doyle\" is a specific entity within that domain. The question is inquiring about the films that include this character, which means it is seeking information about the relationships and instances of these entities. This does not fit C02 (human), as it is not directly about a person or individual; while the character might be portrayed by a human, the focus is on the film and character entities themselves. It also does not align with C03 (description), as it is not requesting an explanation or definition of the character or films. There is no need for numeric data (C04), location information (C05), or abbreviation meaning (C06). The question centers on identifying specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly asks about specific objects (films) and concepts (character) without any elements that would suggest other categories, such as human focus, description, or numeric requirements."

It is not seeking a direct fact or a single piece of data but rather a step-by-step guide or explanation on how to access or compile such a list. The information requested pertains to the procedure for finding the list, which involves understanding how to search for or retrieve data related to celebrities' real names.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be descriptive in nature, providing an explanation, steps, or advice on how to find the list. For instance, a response might include suggestions like using search engines, checking databases, or explaining the concept of real names versus stage names. The answer format could involve bullet points, paragraphs, or a combination of instructions and context, but it should not be a simple numerical value, a location, or a definition of a term. The characteristics of the expected answer are explanatory and procedural, focusing on detailing the process rather than stating a fact.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how can i find,\" which explicitly requests a method or explanation, and \"list of celebrities' real names,\" which refers to a concept or information set. These elements align with the category C03 (\"description\"), as they indicate a need for detailed information or a breakdown of the process. Other indicative phrases might include \"explain,\" \"what is,\" or \"how to,\" but here, \"how can i find\" is central to seeking a descriptive response.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (\"description\") because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation or detailed information on how to perform a specific task. Unlike categories that focus on specific facts (e.g., C01 for entities or C04 for numbers), this query requires a descriptive answer that elaborates on the steps involved in finding a list, such as searching online resources, using directories, or understanding privacy aspects. For example, a response might describe how to use Google, IMDb, or other platforms to compile such a list, which involves providing context and instructions rather than a simple fact. This contrasts with other categories: it is not about identifying a particular entity (C01), a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The use of \"how\" emphasizes the procedural and explanatory nature, fitting C03 perfectly.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's focus on seeking a method or explanation aligns clearly with the definition of C03."

    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\n### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" This query is seeking information about a specific animal or bird (\"fowl\") that follows the \"Chinese Year of the Monkey\" in the context of the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year associated with an animal sign. After the Year of the Monkey, the next year is the Year of the Rooster, so the question is likely referring to the rooster as the fowl that gains prominence or attention. The core request is for a specific entity, which is an object or concept (in this case, a bird), rather than a person, place, number, or explanation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a specific noun or short phrase identifying the entity in question, such as \"rooster\" or \"chicken,\" based on the zodiac cycle. This indicates a direct, factual response rather than a narrative, definition, or numerical value. The answer format is concise and categorical, focusing on naming or describing a particular thing, which aligns with the characteristics of a question seeking an entity. There is no indication of needing dates, quantities, or descriptive details, so the response is expected to be straightforward and entity-focused.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"fowl,\" which refers to a bird or poultry animal, and \"after the chinese year of the monkey,\" which is a cultural reference to the Chinese zodiac cycle. The phrase \"grabs the spotlight\" is idiomatic for gaining attention or prominence, but it does not change the core inquiry about the entity. Category C01 (\"entity\") is indicated by words like \"fowl,\" which denotes a specific object or concept, and the context of the Chinese zodiac, which involves defining and referencing particular animals as entities. Other categories are less relevant: no human is mentioned, no location or abbreviation is involved, and the question does not ask for a description or numeric value.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" is classified under C01 (\"entity\") because it directly asks for a specific object or concept—the fowl associated with the next year in the Chinese zodiac cycle. In this case, the entity is the rooster, which is a well-defined animal in the zodiac system. The question is not inquiring about a person (C02), as it focuses on an animal, nor is it seeking an explanation or definition (C03), a number or date (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular entity, making C01 the most appropriate category. The cultural context reinforces this, as the Chinese zodiac involves entities like the monkey, rooster, etc., which are specific concepts in the question.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification, as the question explicitly requests a specific entity (the fowl following the Year of the Monkey) and aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, while excluding all other categories based on the question's structure and key phrases."

    "label": "C06",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is \"what is the full form of com ?\". This is a query that seeks the expanded or complete version of the abbreviation \"com\". The core request is to provide the meaning or definition of \"com\", which is likely an acronym or shortened form of a word or phrase. The question type is focused on decoding a shortened expression, indicating a need for clarification or explanation related to a specific linguistic or technical term.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format is descriptive, typically a phrase or sentence that explains what \"com\" stands for, such as \"Computer Organization and Management\" or \"Commercial\" (depending on the context). It is not numerical, as it does not require a number, date, or quantity; nor is it location-based, as it does not ask for a place or spatial information. The answer is likely to be a textual explanation rather than a simple word or data point, emphasizing the need for interpretation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"full form\" and \"com\". \"Full form\" is a common phrase used when asking for the expanded version of an abbreviation or acronym. \"Com\" itself is a short form that could represent various terms (e.g., \"Communications\" in computing or \"Company\" in business), but the question is explicitly about its meaning. These elements align with the C06 category, which is defined for questions seeking the meaning of abbreviations or acronyms. Other potential indicators include phrases like \"what does\" or \"abbreviation for,\" but here \"full form\" is the primary cue.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question \"what is the full form of com ?\" directly falls under the C06 category (abbreviation) because it is inquiring about the meaning of an abbreviated term. Abbreviations are condensed forms of words or phrases, and questions that ask for their \"full form\" are specifically designed to decode or explain these shortened expressions. In this case, \"com\" is likely an acronym (e.g., for \"Communication\" or \"Computer\"), and the query requires a descriptive response that defines it. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) involves questions about specific objects or concepts, but here the focus is on an abbreviation, not a standalone entity.  \n- C02 (human) relates to people or individuals, which is irrelevant here.  \n- C03 (description) could involve explanations, but the specific phrasing \"full form\" targets abbreviations more precisely.  \n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers, which is not applicable.  \n- C05 (location) concerns places, which does not fit.  \nThus, the question's intent is to clarify an abbreviation, making C06 the most appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C06  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly asks for the full form of \"com\", which is a standard query for abbreviations, and the category description aligns perfectly with seeking the meaning of acronyms or shortened forms."

The information requested is not a simple fact like a date or a location, but rather a conceptual or categorical answer about a type of human occupation. The question implies a search for knowledge about professions in general, with a focus on their historical origins, which suggests an interest in human activities and societal development.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a textual response, such as a noun phrase or a short explanation, e.g., \"farming\" or \"medicine,\" or a brief description like \"the oldest profession is often said to be prostitution, dating back to ancient civilizations.\" This format indicates that the answer is not numerical, locational, or focused on a specific abbreviation. Instead, it involves providing information about a human-centric concept, which could include historical context, definitions, or examples tied to human roles.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"oldest\" and \"profession.\" \"Profession\" is a term that inherently refers to an occupation performed by humans, such as jobs, trades, or roles in society. \"Oldest\" adds a historical dimension, suggesting an inquiry into the origins of human activities. Phrases like \"what is\" are common in questions that seek explanations or identifications, but in this context, they point to human-related information because professions are defined by human behavior, culture, and evolution. There are no indicators of numeric, locational, or abbreviation-focused queries, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the oldest profession?\" should be classified under C02 - human because it fundamentally asks about human occupations and their historical significance. A profession is a concept deeply rooted in human society, involving activities performed by individuals for livelihood, such as farming, teaching, or craftsmanship. The question seeks to identify or describe a profession that is considered the oldest, which inherently ties it to human history, culture, and development. For instance, answering this question might involve discussing how professions emerged from human needs, such as survival, trade, or specialization, making it a human-related inquiry. While the question could be interpreted as seeking a description (C03), the core focus is on the human aspect of professions, as they are not abstract entities but are tied to people's lives. This aligns with the C02 category, which encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, rather than purely definitional or numerical ones.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the reasoning aligns with the provided correct label and the question's inherent focus on human occupations."

It is not seeking a specific fact like a definition in isolation but rather a comprehensive explanation or breakdown of the concept. The phrase \"what are\" typically indicates a request for descriptive information, such as what something is, how it works, or its significance. This suggests the question is focused on providing detailed knowledge about the topic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive response, likely including a definition, explanation of what liver enzymes are, their roles in the body, and perhaps examples or related details. It is not a simple numerical value, a yes/no answer, or a list of facts; instead, it requires a narrative or explanatory format. This aligns with categories that demand elaboration rather than concise data points.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what are,\" which is a common interrogative for seeking definitions or explanations. The phrase \"liver enzymes\" refers to a biological concept, but the question is not asking for identification of a specific entity (like \"what is liver enzymes?\"), nor is it focused on a person, number, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it prompts for a detailed description, which is indicated by the word \"are\" implying an explanation or definition. This use of language points strongly to the C03 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what are liver enzymes?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a concept. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek to describe or elaborate on something, such as providing a definition, explaining mechanisms, or offering contextual details. In this case, the question is not requesting a specific entity (C01), human-related information (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation's meaning (C06).

The core information being sought is the name of a person, which implies a human subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is a proper noun, likely a name or a specific reference to a historical or fictional figure. It should be concise and directly identify the person, such as \"Billy the Kid\" or a similar name. The answer format does not involve numbers, dates, locations, or explanations, but rather a straightforward naming of an individual. This suggests the answer is categorical and human-focused.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey phrases include \"name,\" \"scar faced,\" \"bounty hunter,\" and \"old west.\" The word \"name\" directly indicates a request for an identifier, typically of a person. \"Bounty hunter\" refers to a profession associated with human individuals, and \"scar faced\" describes a physical characteristic, which is often used in narratives to identify specific people. The context \"of the old west\" narrows it to a human-centric theme, such as Western folklore or history, where characters like bounty hunters are central. These elements collectively point to a human-related inquiry.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the name of a specific person—a bounty hunter with a scar from the old west. Bounty hunters are roles typically associated with human individuals, and the description \"scar faced\" further emphasizes a personal, human characteristic. The request to \"name\" this individual means the answer must identify a human being, rather than an object, concept, or place. While \"bounty hunter\" could be seen as an entity, the question's focus on naming a particular one shifts it to human identification. This aligns with the C02 category, which covers questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. It does not fit C01 (entity) because entities are broader concepts or things, not specific people; C03 (description) is incorrect as it involves explaining or detailing, not naming; C04 (numeric) is unrelated to numbers; C05 (location) deals with places; and C06 (abbreviation) involves acronyms, which is not present here.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly targets a specific human individual based on the description and context."

The core request is for a precise piece of data that can be expressed numerically, such as a year or a full date.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question is typically a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., \"1948\") or a date (e.g., \"October 2, 1948\"). This format involves numbers, dates, or measurements, which are quantifiable and often used to specify exact times. The answer does not require subjective interpretation, detailed explanation, or other non-numeric forms; it is straightforward and fact-based.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"when\" and \"born.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that often prompts questions about dates, times, or durations, which can be numeric. \"Born\" refers to a specific event with a definable date. These words point to a query that seeks factual, numerical data rather than descriptive, locational, or identity-based information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"when was ozzy osbourne born ?\" directly asks for a birth date, which is a type of measurement or quantity. Dates and years fall under the numeric category (C04) because they involve numerical representations (e.g., day, month, year numbers). While the question references a human (Ozzy Osbourne), the specific focus is on a quantifiable fact about him, not on his identity, life story, or other human-related aspects that would fit under C02. It also does not seek a description, location, or abbreviation, ruling out other categories. The expected answer format reinforces this, as it requires a number or date, aligning with C04's definition of questions asking for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. Therefore, the classification is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a numerical value (date or year) and matches the category's focus on quantifiable information."

In physics, this question relates to concepts like Newton's second law of motion (F = ma) and the effects of gravity and friction. Heavier objects may accelerate faster downhill due to greater gravitational force, but this depends on factors like the coefficient of friction. The question requires a detailed, descriptive answer that breaks down the reasons, such as how mass influences acceleration, rather than providing a single fact, number, or definition. This contrasts with other categories: C01 (entity) would involve identifying objects, C02 (human) would focus on people, C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, C05 (location) would deal with places, and C06 (abbreviation) would seek meanings of acronyms.

Specifically, it appears to be inquiring about a notable individual associated with the New York Yankees, a well-known baseball team. The phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is idiomatic and commonly used in sports contexts to refer to a star player or a figure of great achievement for the team. Therefore, the information being requested is about a specific human being, likely a famous athlete or historical figure from Yankees history.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as a name, or a brief description of a person. Given the context, the response would probably be a specific individual's name (e.g., \"Babe Ruth\" or \"Mickey Mantle\"), as these are common references in discussions about \"the pride of the Yankees.\" The answer does not require a number, date, definition, or other types of information; it is focused on identifying a human subject. The format suggests a direct identification or reference to a person, rather than an explanation or quantitative data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"who\" – This is a direct interrogative pronoun that typically signals a question about a person, aligning with the \"human\" category.\n- Key phrases: \"the pride of the yankees\" – This phrase is culturally and contextually linked to human figures in sports, particularly in baseball. It evokes the idea of a prominent individual who embodies pride or excellence for the team, reinforcing the focus on a person rather than an object, concept, or location.\n- \"yankees\" – While this refers to a sports team (an entity), the question is not about the team itself but about \"who\" (a person) was that pride, shifting the focus to human-related information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"who was the pride of the yankees?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it explicitly asks for information about a person. The word \"who\" is a strong indicator of a human-focused query, as it seeks to identify or describe an individual. In this case, the phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is a metaphorical expression that commonly refers to a famous human being, such as Babe Ruth, who is often called \"the Pride of the Yankees.\" This context confirms that the question is not about an object (C01), a concept or definition (C03), a number or measurement (C04), a place (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is centered on human-related information, specifically identifying a person associated with a team. The expected answer, such as a name or brief description, further supports this classification, as it does not involve quantitative data, spatial details, or acronym meanings.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key words (\"who\" and idiomatic sports reference) clearly point to a human subject, and the context of \"the pride of the yankees\" is universally understood to refer to a person in this domain."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what is considered the costliest disaster the insurance industry has ever faced?\" This is inquiring about a specific event or occurrence that is recognized as the most expensive disaster in terms of insurance losses. The information being requested is the identification of a particular disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or other catastrophic event, rather than a general discussion or list of disasters. It seeks a named or defined entity that fits the description of being the costliest.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely to be a specific name or description of a disaster, such as \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami,\" which are examples of entities. The answer may include details like the name, date, or type of disaster, but it is not expected to be a numerical value, a definition, or a list. The response should be concise and point to a particular thing, as the question is focused on retrieval or identification rather than explanation or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"costliest disaster,\" \"insurance industry,\" and \"ever faced.\" \"Disaster\" is central to the query, and it is modified by \"costliest,\" which specifies a particular instance. This language suggests a search for a specific entity, as it implies the existence of a well-known or recognized disaster that meets the criteria. There are no indicators of human involvement, location, abbreviation, or numeric focus, which helps narrow down the category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing—the costliest disaster from the insurance industry's perspective. An entity in this context refers to a distinct and identifiable event, such as a natural disaster, accident, or other insured catastrophe. The question does not seek a general description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor does it ask for a number, date, or quantity (C04). It also does not focus on a person or human element (C02), a geographical place (C05), or an acronym's meaning (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular disaster, which is an entity, as it is a specific thing that can be referenced by name or description. For example, the answer might be \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The Great East Japan Earthquake,\" both of which are entities in the context of historical events.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly requests a specific disaster, which aligns with the definition of an entity as a particular thing or concept, and the reasoning steps confirm that no other category fits the query's focus on identification and retrieval."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking \"what sprawling U.S. state boasts the most airports?\" This is inquiring about a specific U.S. state that possesses a high number of airports, with the adjective \"sprawling\" providing additional descriptive context. The primary information being requested is the identification of a state, which is a type of geographical entity. The question seeks a name or identifier for a location, rather than a definition, explanation, or numerical value in isolation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a state (e.g., \"California\" or \"Texas\"), as the question begins with \"what,\" which typically prompts a categorical or locative response. The answer may implicitly involve a comparison or quantity (e.g., \"California has the most airports\"), but the core output is the state's name, which is a spatial reference. The answer could include a brief explanation or context due to the \"sprawling\" descriptor, but it is fundamentally a locative response. Characteristics include brevity, as it's a direct question for identification, and potential use of geographical terms.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This explicitly refers to a geographical location within the United States.\n- \"sprawling\": This describes a spatial characteristic, implying size or extent, which is relevant to location-based inquiries.\n- \"boasts the most airports\": This phrase involves a comparison of quantities (e.g., the highest number), but it is subordinate to the identification of the state. It does not directly request a number or date, but rather uses it as context for locating the answer.\n- Overall, the question centers on finding a specific place, with \"location\" being the primary theme.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about a geographical area—the U.S. state. The phrase \"U.S. state\" directly invokes a category of location, and the word \"sprawling\" reinforces the spatial aspect by describing the state's physical extent. While the question mentions \"the most airports,\" which could be interpreted as having a numerical component, the core request is for the identification of the state, not the number itself. Category C05 encompasses questions that seek information about places, including their characteristics or comparisons tied to spatial elements. In contrast:\n- C01 (entity) might apply to broader concepts, but here the focus is specifically on a location rather than a general object or idea.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no mention of people or human activities.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, but this question is not seeking detailed information about airports or states; it's asking for a specific answer.\n- C04 (numeric) could be partially relevant due to the \"most airports\" part, but the question is not primarily about numbers; it's using the numerical aspect to identify a location.\n- C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as there are no abbreviations in the question.\nThus, the classification aligns with C05 because the question is fundamentally about locating a specific place based on its attributes.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's focus on a U.S. state and its spatial characteristics clearly matches the definition of C05, which is for questions about geographical locations."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is: \"what did the only repealed amendment to the u s constitution deal with?\" This phrasing indicates a request for information about the content or subject matter of a specific historical amendment. The focus is on explaining what this amendment addressed, rather than identifying it directly or providing a simple fact. The question is not asking for a definition of the amendment itself but rather for a detailed explanation of its provisions, which suggests it is seeking descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a detailed explanation, definition, or historical account. For instance, the answer might describe the amendment's purpose, key provisions, or context, such as prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages. This format involves providing context and elaboration, rather than a short answer like a date, number, or simple identification. The answer should be informative and explanatory in nature, aligning with a non-numerical and non-factual enumeration style.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what did ... deal with?\" and \"repealed amendment.\" The phrase \"deal with\" is a common indicator for questions seeking descriptions or explanations of topics. Additionally, \"repealed amendment\" refers to a specific historical event, but the question is not focused on identifying the amendment or its number; instead, it asks for its content. This use of language points toward a category that involves explaining or detailing information, which is characteristic of C03 - description. Other categories, like C01 (entity) or C02 (human), might be considered if the question were about a specific object or person, but here the emphasis is on the amendment's subject matter.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question should be classified under C03 - description because it is asking for an explanation or detailed account of what the only repealed amendment dealt with. The 18th Amendment, which was repealed by the 21st Amendment, prohibited the production and sale of alcohol in the United States. The question seeks not just a simple fact (e.g., \"alcohol prohibition\") but a broader description of its implications, historical context, and reasons. This aligns with the C03 category, which covers questions that request explanations, definitions, or detailed information. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about a specific object or concept in isolation; it's about the content of one. It also doesn't fit C02 (human) as no people are central to the query. Numeric (C04) is irrelevant since no numbers or dates are requested. Location (C05) doesn't apply as the question isn't about a place. Abbreviation (C06) is not relevant because the question isn't inquiring about the meaning of an acronym. The core request for descriptive information, such as what the amendment covered, makes C03 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and wording clearly indicate a need for descriptive information, matching the C03 category."

The information being requested is the date, implying a temporal measurement, such as a day, month, and year, or a specific numerical representation of when Boxing Day happens.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a date, which could be expressed in various ways, such as \"December 26\" (for Boxing Day in many countries), \"Dec 26,\" or a full date like \"December 26, 2023.\" This format involves numerical elements (e.g., the day number, month abbreviation or name, and optionally the year).\n- Characteristics of the answer: It is quantitative, as it deals with numbers (e.g., the day of the month, month number, or year), and it may include references to calendar systems. The answer is not descriptive or narrative but rather a factual, numerical response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"date\" – This word is central to the question and directly relates to time or measurement, often involving numbers (e.g., day, month, year).\n- \"boxing day\" – This is a specific entity (C01), but the question is not asking about the entity itself (e.g., its definition or history) but rather about its date. The phrase \"date of\" modifies the query, emphasizing the need for a numerical or temporal answer.\n- Category indicators: The word \"date\" strongly suggests a numeric category, as dates are inherently numerical constructs. Other categories like C03 (description) or C05 (location) do not fit, as the question is not seeking an explanation or a place.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the date of boxing day?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is explicitly asking for a numerical value or measurement related to time. Boxing Day is an event, but the query focuses on its date, which is a specific point in time expressed through numbers. For instance, in many regions, Boxing Day is fixed on December 26, involving the number 26 for the day and 12 for the month (or December). Even if the date varies by country or year, the core request is for a numerical representation, such as a day count or calendar date.\n- This aligns with the definition of C04, which includes questions about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. The expected answer format (e.g., a date string with numbers) reinforces this, as it is not about describing the event (C03), identifying a person (C02), specifying a location (C05), or explaining an abbreviation (C06). The word \"date\" acts as a clear indicator, shifting the focus from the entity \"boxing day\" to its temporal aspect, which is inherently numeric.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly requests a numerical date, and the analysis confirms it fits the C04 category based on key words, expected answer format, and category definitions."

It asks for \"articles of clothing\" that are used as \"tokens.\" Tokens in Monopoly are the physical or symbolic pieces players use to move around the board, such as the car, dog, or other themed pieces. The request is for identifying particular clothing-related items that serve this purpose, implying a need to list or describe these entities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\n- The expected answer format would likely involve listing specific objects or providing details about the clothing articles that are tokens. For example, in some editions of Monopoly, tokens might include items like a penguin suit (which is clothing-themed) or other representations. The answer could be a list, a set of names, or a brief description, but it should focus on concrete, identifiable entities rather than abstract concepts, numbers, or locations.\n- Characteristics: The response is expected to be informative and specific, drawing from knowledge of the game. It does not require a numerical value, a date, or a geographical location, nor does it involve explaining a concept or acronym.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\n- Key words: \"articles of clothing\" – this phrase refers to specific, tangible items or objects, such as hats, coats, or suits.\n- \"are tokens\" – this indicates a relationship to game elements, but the core is about identifying the entities themselves.\n- \"in monopoly\" – this provides context but does not change the nature of the inquiry; it anchors the question to a specific domain.\n- Category indicators: The question uses \"what\" to request identification of particular things, aligning with the \"entity\" category (C01). There are no words suggesting people (e.g., \"who\"), numbers (e.g., \"how many\"), locations (e.g., \"where\"), or abbreviations (e.g., \"what does X mean\").\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\n- The question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for specific objects or concepts that exist within the game of Monopoly. \"Articles of clothing\" are concrete entities—physical items like clothing pieces—and the question seeks to identify which of these are used as tokens. This involves recognizing and naming particular things, such as \"the penguin suit\" or \"the wheelbarrow\" (though the wheelbarrow might not be clothing, the question might be interpreted broadly or in a specific edition where clothing is involved).\n- To determine this, consider the definition of C01: \"Questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things.\" Here, the question is focused on identifying particular entities (clothing items) that have a functional role in the game. It is not asking for a description (C03), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an explanation of an acronym (C06). The key phrase \"what articles of clothing\" directly prompts the retrieval of specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n- For instance, if the answer were \"In some versions of Monopoly, the penguin suit is a token,\" it would still be an entity-based response, as it names a specific object. The question does not require a numerical count or a spatial description, so other categories do not fit.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the classification is correct, as the question clearly requests specific objects or things within a defined context, aligning with the C01 category.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The word \"name\" indicates that the answer should provide the names of these individuals, and \"11 famous martyrs\" specifies the subject matter, which involves people who have been killed or sacrificed for their beliefs, often in historical or religious contexts. This suggests that the question is focused on human beings and their identities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a list of names or a set of references to specific human individuals. For example, the response might include names like \"Saint Stephen\" or \"Oscar Romero,\" along with brief context if needed. The answer does not require numerical calculations, descriptive explanations, or spatial details; instead, it demands the identification of people. The inclusion of \"11\" implies a count, but it does not change the core request for human-related information, as the number is simply specifying the quantity of individuals to be named.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"name,\" \"famous,\" and \"martyrs.\" \"Name\" directly relates to identifying entities, but in this context, it is paired with \"martyrs,\" which is a term referring to human individuals who have been persecuted or killed for their beliefs. \"Famous\" further emphasizes that these are well-known people, reinforcing the human aspect. There are no words indicating a focus on objects (like \"entity\"), places (like \"location\"), definitions (like \"description\"), numbers or quantities beyond identification (like \"numeric\"), or abbreviations (like \"abbreviation\"). This points strongly to the human category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"name 11 famous martyrs\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the identification of specific individuals—martyrs—who are human beings. Category C02 encompasses questions that involve people, their attributes, or human-related information. In this case, the query is not seeking a definition (C03), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires naming human figures, which aligns with the essence of C02. Even though \"martyrs\" can be seen as a concept, it is applied to people, making the question human-centric. The request for \"11\" does not shift the focus to numeric data but rather specifies the number of human individuals to be identified, further supporting the classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly involves identifying specific human individuals and aligns perfectly with the definition of category C02."

It is primarily seeking a human subject, so the response should be concise and focused on identifying the individual.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"who,\" \"inventor,\" and \"silly putty.\" \n- \"Who\" is a pronoun that explicitly directs the question toward human beings or individuals.\n- \"Inventor\" is a role or title associated with people, emphasizing human agency and creation.\n- \"Silly putty\" is the object of interest, but it is not the focus; the question is meta, asking about the human behind it.\nThese keywords align with the C02 category, which is defined for questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, other categories might be indicated by words like \"what\" (for entities), \"how many\" (for numeric), or \"where\" (for location).\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"who was the inventor of silly putty?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking for information about a specific person. The category C02 encompasses questions that inquire about individuals, their roles, or human-related details. In this case:\n- The word \"who\" clearly signals a focus on human identity.\n- \"Inventor\" specifies a human role, as it refers to a person who created something, which falls under human-related information.\n- While \"silly putty\" is an entity (potentially fitting C01), the question is not centered on the object itself but on the human inventor, making it a human-centric query.\n- This contrasts with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about silly putty's properties or definition, e.g., \"what is silly putty?\"\n  - C03 (description) would be for questions seeking detailed explanations, e.g., \"describe the invention of silly putty.\"\n  - C04 (numeric) would involve quantities, e.g., \"how many versions of silly putty exist?\"\n  - C05 (location) would ask about places, e.g., \"where was silly putty invented?\"\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant here, as there is no abbreviation involved.\n- Therefore, the question's primary intent is to identify a person, which aligns perfectly with the C02 category's definition of questions asking about people or human-related information.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly uses \"who\" to inquire about a human individual and focuses on a human role (inventor), which is explicitly covered by the C02 category."

This is a request for a specific golf course located in Myrtle Beach. The core information being sought is the name or identity of a particular golf course, which implies the need to identify or specify an entity. The question does not ask for a general explanation, a quantity, a date, or the meaning of an acronym; it directly seeks a named example of a golf course.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Myrtle Beach Country Club\" or \"The Links at Myrtle Beach\". This format is concise and direct, focusing on the identification of a single entity. It does not require a numerical value, a descriptive paragraph, a date, or an expanded form of an abbreviation. The answer is expected to be a specific reference to an object or concept, aligning with the characteristics of an entity-based response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"golf course\", \"name\", and \"in myrtle beach\". \"Golf course\" refers to a specific object or concept, which is a classic example of an entity. \"Name\" indicates the need to identify or specify something, reinforcing the entity category. \"In myrtle beach\" provides contextual information about the location but does not alter the fundamental request for an entity; it simply narrows the scope to a specific area. These elements collectively point to the category C01, as the question is focused on naming or referencing a particular thing.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"name a golf course in myrtle beach\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific golf course, which is an instance of an entity. An entity category encompasses questions that seek information about particular objects, concepts, or things, such as names of places, items, or organizations. In this case, \"golf course\" is a concrete object, and the phrase \"name a\" directs the response to provide a specific example, like a proper noun. This contrasts with other categories: it is not a description (e.g., asking \"what is a golf course?\"), not numeric (e.g., \"how many golf courses are in Myrtle Beach?\"), not location (e.g., asking about Myrtle Beach itself), and not abbreviation (e.g., \"what does GC stand for?\"). The focus on identifying a golf course as a distinct entity makes C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a specific golf course, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an entity category."

The core request is for geographical information, focusing on the spatial relationship between the bay and the states that enclose it. The question seeks to identify the boundaries or adjacent areas of a particular location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing two state names, such as \"Maryland and Virginia,\" which are proper nouns referring to political entities. The answer is not expected to be a definition, a numerical value, or a detailed explanation. Instead, it should be concise and directly address the spatial aspect of the query. The characteristics of the answer include being specific to geography and involving the identification of locations that are directly related to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"states,\" \"enclose,\" and \"chesapeake bay.\" \"Chesapeake Bay\" is a proper noun that refers to a well-known geographical feature, indicating a location. \"States\" refers to political divisions, but in this context, it is part of the spatial inquiry. \"Enclose\" implies a spatial or geographical relationship, such as boundaries or surrounding areas. These elements point toward a question focused on places or spatial information, aligning with the C05 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"which two states enclose chesapeake bay ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it directly asks about geographical locations and their spatial relationships. The Chesapeake Bay is a specific place, and the query seeks information about the states that border it, which involves identifying spatial enclosures. This fits the C05 category description of \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In contrast, it does not fall under C01 (entity) because while states are entities, the focus here is on their role in relation to a location, not the entities themselves. It is not C02 (human) as no people or human elements are involved. It excludes C03 (description) because the answer does not require an explanation or definition. It is not C04 (numeric) since no numbers or measurements are requested, and it is not C06 (abbreviation) as there is no mention of abbreviations. The question is purely spatial, making C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly focuses on geographical locations and spatial information, which is the core of the C05 category, and the reasoning aligns with the provided category descriptions."

The core request is for a specific numerical value, indicating that the user is seeking a count or measurement rather than a description, definition, or other type of information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question is asking for a \"number\" of points. For example, a typical response might be a specific integer, such as \"300\" for standard bowling, but in this case, it's tailored to fivepin bowling. The answer should be a precise quantity, possibly with units (e.g., \"300 points\"), and it should not involve descriptive text, dates, or other non-numeric elements. The characteristics of the expected answer include being quantifiable and measurable, aligning with the definition of a numeric question.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"points,\" and \"perfect fivepin bowling score.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a direct indicator of a request for a quantity or count, which is central to numeric questions. \"Points\" refers to a unit of measurement in scoring, often numerical in nature. The context \"perfect fivepin bowling score\" provides background but does not change the fundamental request for a number. Other categories, such as description or entity, might involve explaining what points are or what a score entails, but this question is explicitly asking for a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a specific numerical value. The word \"how many\" is a strong signal that the user is seeking a quantity, and the subject matter (points in bowling) is inherently numerical, as scores are measured in discrete units. This is not a question about an entity (e.g., \"What is a fivepin bowling score?\"), a human (e.g., \"Who invented fivepin bowling?\"), a description (e.g., \"Explain how fivepin bowling works?\"), a location (e.g., \"Where is fivepin bowling played?\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"What does PIN stand for in bowling?\"). Instead, it requires a number, making C04 the appropriate classification. The context of a \"perfect score\" implies a fixed or standard quantity, further supporting the numeric nature of the question.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a request for a numerical answer."

The request is for information about an entity (a company) that meets certain criteria, but the way it's phrased implies a need to provide more than just a simple name; it requires contextual or descriptive details to pinpoint the correct company.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a company, such as \"Nintendo\" or \"Sega\", but it may also include a brief explanation or context to justify why that company is the one that sells the \"super system\". For instance, the answer might involve describing the company's role in video game hardware manufacturing and its product lineup. The answer format could be a sentence or phrase that provides a complete response, rather than just a list or a number, indicating that descriptive elements are part of the expected output.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"which company\", \"manufactures\", \"sells\", and \"super system\". These phrases suggest a focus on identifying an organization (an entity) but also imply that the answer requires specifying which one based on its actions and products. The term \"super system\" might refer to a specific product like the Super Nintendo or similar, and the question is framed to seek detailed information about the company in relation to this product, rather than just a direct reference to an object or a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question is classified under C02 (description) because it is not primarily asking for a simple identification of an entity (like C01) or a numerical value (like C04).

The core request is for a number, indicating that the answer will be a digit or a numerical expression, rather than a descriptive or categorical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question uses the phrase \"how many,\" which typically elicits a response like a specific number (e.g., \"There are 16 Community Chest cards in Monopoly\"). The answer may include a brief context or confirmation, but it must primarily be a quantity. Characteristics include: it could be a fixed number (e.g., from game rules), a date (though unlikely here), or a measurement (e.g., count).

The request is not for a specific fact, such as a definition of \"Mormon\" or a list of members, but rather for an explanation or detailed account of what they hold as true. This indicates that the question is seeking interpretive or descriptive information about a concept or belief system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a detailed explanation, such as a breakdown of key beliefs (e.g., the nature of God, salvation through Jesus Christ, the role of scripture, or end-times prophecies). The response should be explanatory and may include definitions or elaborations on concepts, rather than a simple fact, number, or location. For instance, an answer might describe Mormon theology in depth, which aligns with the need for descriptive content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what do mormons believe\", where \"believe\" is a central phrase that signals an inquiry into opinions, doctrines, or explanatory information. \"Mormons\" refers to a religious entity, but the question is not focused on identifying or describing the entity itself (which would be entity-related) but on what they believe, which emphasizes the need for descriptive details.

The core request is for a numerical value or count, indicating that the user wants to know the exact or approximate number of people associated with this linguistic group. This suggests the question is seeking factual, statistical information rather than subjective or descriptive details.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a numerical response, such as a specific number (e.g., \"Approximately 300 million\"), a range (e.g., \"Between 100 and 400 million\"), or a reference to a data source. The characteristics of the answer are quantitative, meaning it deals with measurements, counts, or numerical data. It does not require a narrative, definition, or qualitative explanation, but rather a direct or indirect numerical output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"people,\" and \"speak french.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a strong indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value. \"People\" refers to a human group, but in this context, it is part of the count being sought. \"Speak french\" specifies the subject of the count, but the focus is on the numerical aspect. These elements align with the C04 category, which is defined by questions seeking numbers, dates, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThis question should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity—the number of people who speak French worldwide. The use of \"how many\" directly points to a request for a count or measurement, which is a hallmark of the numeric category. Unlike C01 (entity), which would involve questions about the nature or identity of something (e.g., \"What is French?\"), this question is not seeking a definition or conceptual explanation. It also differs from C02 (human), which focuses on individuals or human-related topics without necessarily requiring a number (e.g., \"Who is the president of France?\"). There is no element of description, location, or abbreviation here; the question is purely quantitative. The expected answer is a number, not a descriptive paragraph or geographical reference, further confirming the C04 classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question unambiguously seeks a numerical answer, matching the core definition of the C04 category."

It is not asking for general information about the statue, but rather a precise measurement in inches that exceeds six feet. The core request is for a quantity, which indicates a focus on numerical data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a numerical value, such as a number followed by a unit (e.g., \"X inches\"), where X represents the exact measurement. This suggests that the answer is quantitative and does not require descriptive, qualitative, or categorical information. The question implies a calculation or direct retrieval of a number, as it involves a comparison (over six feet) and a specific unit (inches).\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how many inches\" and \"over six feet.\" These phrases explicitly reference units of measurement and a request for a count or quantity. \"Inches\" and \"feet\" are standard units for measuring length, which are commonly associated with numeric questions. There are no words indicating a need for descriptive, locational, or human-related information, further supporting a numeric focus.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical answer involving a measurement. It seeks the exact number of inches that the Venus de Milo statue exceeds six feet by, which requires a specific quantity. This is not a question about an entity (C01), as it's not inquiring about the statue itself in a general sense; not about a human (C02), as it doesn't involve people; not about a description (C03), as it doesn't ask for an explanation or definition; not about a location (C05), as it's not concerned with places; and not about an abbreviation (C06), as it doesn't involve acronyms or short forms. The presence of measurement units and the direct request for a number confirm the numeric classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly demands a numerical response, aligning perfectly with the definition of C04."

This type of question focuses on understanding the concept deeply, rather than identifying a particular object, person, number, place, or acronym.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive, explanatory, or definitional response. It could involve providing a detailed explanation, such as breaking down learning into components (e.g., cognitive processes, behavioral changes), referencing educational theories (e.g., constructivism or behaviorism), or offering examples to illustrate the nature of learning. The answer format is likely to be textual and narrative, emphasizing depth and clarity, rather than being numerical, concise, or factual in a simple way.

The phrasing is informal (\"u s state\" likely means \"U.S. state\") and uses \"lived under six flags,\" which may refer to a state's history of being governed by multiple entities, such as European powers or other influences. The core request is to identify a particular state within the United States that fits this criterion. This suggests the question is focused on retrieving a named entity with a geographical and historical context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, specifically the name of a U.S. state (e.g., \"Georgia\" or \"Louisiana\"), as the question begins with \"what U.S. state.\" The answer should be concise and directly identify a location, rather than providing a detailed explanation, definition, or numerical data. The characteristics of the response include being a specific, named place with historical significance, but the primary output is the identification of the state itself, not the description of its history.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This directly refers to a specific entity within the United States, emphasizing a geographical or political boundary.\n- \"lived under six flags\": This phrase introduces a historical or descriptive element, but it is tied to the state's location and its past associations with different flags, which are symbolic representations of control or sovereignty over a place.\n- Overall, the question is inquiring about a place with a particular attribute, but the attribute (\"lived under six flags\") does not change the fundamental request for a location.\n\nThese elements align with categories that deal with places, objects, or concepts. The word \"state\" here is not just any entity but specifically a political division within a country, which is inherently geographical.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a specific geographical area within the United States. The phrase \"U.S. state\" explicitly indicates a location, as U.S. states are defined by their boundaries and are part of the geographical landscape. The additional phrase \"lived under six flags\" adds a historical context, but it does not shift the question away from seeking a place; instead, it specifies a characteristic of that location. \n\n- **Comparison with other categories:**\n  - C01 (entity): While a U.S. state can be considered an entity, the category description focuses on \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" but in this case, the state is being treated as a location rather than a general concept. The question is not about the state as an abstract idea but as a physical and historical place.\n  - C02 (human): This category involves people or human-related information, which is irrelevant here as the question is not about individuals.\n  - C03 (description): This would involve explaining or defining something, but the question is asking for a specific answer (a state name), not a detailed explanation.\n  - C04 (numeric): This requires numbers or quantities, but the question does not ask for a count or measurement; it seeks a named entity.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): This deals with meanings of abbreviations, which is not applicable as the question is not about decoding acronyms.\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a U.S. state, which is a type of location, making C05 the most appropriate category. The historical aspect (\"lived under six flags\") is secondary and does not override the primary focus on the geographical entity.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05\n\nConfidence: High, as the question unambiguously asks for a specific U.S. state, which falls under the location category, and the historical detail does not alter this classification."

This indicates that the user is seeking spatial or geographical information, such as a specific place, address, or coordinates. The information being requested is not about an identity or definition but rather about the physical or conceptual location of the subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a location-based response, such as a place name, address, or descriptive spatial information. For example, answers might include a city, street, landmark, or coordinates. The format is typically concise and factual, focusing on providing a clear position rather than a narrative or numerical value. Characteristics include the use of geographical terms or references, and the answer should directly address the \"where\" aspect without delving into other details like descriptions or definitions.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"where\", which is a strong indicator of location-related inquiries. The phrase \"where is\" is a common interrogative structure used to ask for spatial information. The term \"loop\" is ambiguous and could refer to various concepts (e.g., a programming construct, a physical object, or a geographical feature), but the word \"where\" specifies that the focus is on its location. This aligns with the C05 category, which is defined by questions about places or spatial information, rather than entities, descriptions, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where is the loop ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the position or place of \"the loop\". The word \"where\" is a direct cue for location-based queries, and the structure of the question implies a request for geographical or spatial data. For instance, if \"loop\" refers to a physical loop (e.g., in a park or road), the answer would involve its location; if it's metaphorical, it still seeks where it exists or is situated. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would involve asking what \"loop\" is, not its location.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant as there's no reference to people.\n- C03 (description) would require a detailed explanation, but this question is focused on a specific place.\n- C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, which isn't the case here.\n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding an acronym, but \"loop\" isn't an abbreviation.\nThe key phrase \"where is\" reinforces the location intent, and the absence of other cues (like \"who\", \"what\", or \"define\") confirms that C05 is the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a location inquiry, with no conflicting indicators from other categories."

It involves geographical information, specifically inquiring about a capital city and the associated country. The core request is to identify a place or location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a country (e.g., \"Albania\"), which is a specific entity related to a geographical area. The answer format is concise, typically a single word or short phrase, and does not require numerical data, definitions, or explanations.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nThe key words are \"country\", \"capital\", and \"is tirana\". \"Capital\" refers to a city, which is a defined location, and \"country\" is a nation, also a location. The phrase \"what country's capital\" emphasizes a spatial relationship, pointing to a geographical query. There are no indicators of a person, definition, number, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is seeking information about a geographical place. Specifically, it asks for the country whose capital is Tirana, which involves identifying a location (the country) based on its capital city.

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" is an interrogative phrase that directly asks for an explanation or definition of the term \"titanium.\" Titanium is a specific chemical element, and the question is requesting detailed information about its nature, properties, history, or other descriptive aspects. This indicates that the question is not seeking a simple identification or classification but rather a comprehensive explanation, which aligns with the need for descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a detailed, explanatory response, such as a definition, description of characteristics, historical context, or examples of uses. It would not be a short, factual statement or a single piece of data. For instance, a typical answer might include details like \"Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22, known for its strength, low density, and corrosion resistance.\" This format emphasizes explanation and detail, rather than a numerical value, a location, or a concise definition alone. The characteristics of the expected answer are descriptive, informative, and multi-faceted, fitting the nature of a \"description\" query.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nThe key words in the question are \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to request definitions or explanations. Additionally, \"titanium\" refers to a specific entity (a chemical element), but the question is not focused on identifying it as an entity (C01) or asking about a human-related aspect (C02). There are no indicators of a numeric response (e.g., no mention of numbers or dates), location (e.g., no reference to places), or abbreviation (e.g., no acronym or shortened form). The phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a request for descriptive information, as it prompts an explanation rather than a simple fact retrieval.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly seeks an explanation or definition of titanium, which involves providing detailed information about the subject. Titanium is a chemical element, but the question is not asking for it as an entity (C01), which would focus on its classification or identity, nor is it human-related (C02), numeric (C04), location-based (C05), or abbreviation-focused (C06). Instead, the core intent is to understand what titanium is, implying a need for descriptive content such as its atomic properties, discovery, applications, and significance. This matches the category description for C03, which includes questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed information. The expected answer format, as analyzed in Step 2, is descriptive and explanatory, further supporting this classification. Therefore, based on the question's structure and content, C03 is the appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's wording and intent align closely with the definition and characteristics of category C03."

A caldera is a geological feature, and the question is inquiring into its nature, which requires a descriptive response. This contrasts with other categories: it is not an entity (C01) because while a caldera is a specific thing, the question is not focused on identifying or listing entities; it is seeking a definition. It is not human (C02) as it does not involve people or human elements. It is not numeric (C04) since no numbers or quantities are requested.

The subject \"cushman and wakefield\" appears to be a proper noun, likely referring to a specific entity, but the focus is on their known attributes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format for this question would be a descriptive response, such as an explanation, definition, or detailed account of what \"cushman and wakefield\" is famous for. For example, the answer might include historical context, key services (e.g., in real estate), or reasons for their prominence. This format involves providing a narrative or explanatory text, rather than a simple fact, number, or location. The answer is likely to be multi-faceted and informative, aligning with the need for elaboration rather than brevity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"what are ... known for?\" and \"known for.\" These phrases are commonly associated with descriptive inquiries, as they seek explanations of fame, reputation, or defining characteristics. The word \"known\" suggests a focus on recognition or notoriety, which is a hallmark of the \"description\" category. Additionally, \"cushman and wakefield\" could refer to an entity, but the question is not about the entity itself (C01) or its attributes in a literal sense, but about what it is renowned for, which is descriptive.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what are cushman and wakefield known for ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information about the subject's fame or recognition. C03 encompasses questions that seek definitions, explanations, or elaborative details, such as \"what is X known for?\" or \"describe Y.\" In this case, the query is not requesting a specific object (C01), a person or human-related detail (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires a descriptive response that provides context, history, or reasons for the subject's notoriety. For instance, if \"cushman and wakefield\" is a company, the answer might describe its role in the real estate industry, but the question is inherently descriptive in nature, focusing on what they are known for rather than what they are.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C03\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure, key phrases, and expected answer format align closely with the definition of C03, which involves seeking detailed, explanatory information. The use of \"known for\" is a strong indicator of a descriptive query, and there is no ambiguity in the question that would suggest a different category."

The focus is on identifying a particular body of water, such as a sea, ocean, or lake, which is a spatial feature. This indicates that the question is seeking knowledge about a location or place, rather than a general concept, a person, a number, or an abbreviation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or a specific name of a geographical feature, such as \"Black Sea\" or \"Mediterranean Sea\" (though the correct answer is the Black Sea). The answer format is not numerical, explanatory, or definitional; it is a direct reference to a place. This suggests that the question is not asking for a description, a quantity, or a definition, but rather for a specific location.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"body of water\" and \"flow into.\" \"Body of water\" refers to a geographical entity like a sea, ocean, or lake, and \"flow into\" implies a spatial relationship or direction. These words are indicative of location-based inquiries, as they involve spatial positioning and geographical features. There are no words suggesting a need for a number, date, definition, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question belongs to category C05 (location) because it is asking about a geographical or spatial feature. Specifically, it inquires into the destination of the Danube River, which is a body of water, such as the Black Sea. This is a question about a place or location, as it seeks information on where the river terminates, fitting the definition of \"location\" from the category descriptions. While the Danube River itself could be considered an entity (C01), the question is not about the river as a standalone object but about its geographical context and endpoint.

Despite the apparent typos or corrupted text (e.g., \"cd\" might be \"country\", \"nns\" could be \"nations\", and \"nnp\" might be an acronym like \"NNP\" for National Net Product or something similar), the core request is to identify a specific country that was occupied by the Nazis for a certain period, likely indicated by the \"1\" (which could represent a duration, such as 1 year). The question is primarily seeking a geographical location or a specific country name. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" appears to be extraneous or erroneous, but it does not change the fundamental intent of asking about a country. Therefore, the question type is one that asks for a specific place or location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, specifically the name of a country (e.g., \"France\" or \"Poland\"), which is a type of location. It may involve a numerical element if the \"1\" is interpreted as a duration (e.g., \"for 1 year\"), but the primary answer is not a number or date; it's a geographical entity. The answer should be concise, typically a single word or short phrase, and it does not require an explanation or definition, unlike a description-based question. This suggests the answer is categorical and factual, pointing to a specific place.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"country\", which is a direct indicator of a geographical location. Other elements like \"nazis\" (referring to a historical group) and \"occupy\" (implying an action related to a place) support the context of seeking a location. The \"1\" might suggest a quantitative aspect, but it is not the focus; it's likely a modifier specifying the duration of occupation. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" is unclear but does not override the primary intent; if \"cd\" is interpreted as \"country\", it reinforces the location theme. In contrast, words like \"entity\" or \"description\" are absent, and there is no obvious abbreviation or numeric emphasis beyond the \"1\".\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for a specific geographical place (a country) that was occupied by the Nazis. The word \"country\" is a clear indicator of a location, as it refers to a defined territory or nation. The historical context of Nazi occupation involves spatial information, making this a location-based inquiry. While the \"1\" could imply a numeric aspect (e.g., a duration), it is secondary to the main request for a country name. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" does not alter the classification, as it either contains errors or is irrelevant to the core question about a location. This aligns with the category description for C05, which includes questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. The question does not seek an explanation, definition, or abbreviation, nor is it focused on a human or entity in the primary sense.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly references \"country\" and seeks a specific place, which is unambiguously covered by the location category, despite minor ambiguities in the phrasing."

Specifically, it is requesting the name or nature of something considered \"most valuable\" within the context of the state of Nebraska. The core request is to pinpoint a specific thing or concept associated with Nebraska that holds significant value.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a specific resource. This could be a tangible thing like \"agriculture,\" \"natural resources,\" or \"water,\" or perhaps a category like \"tourism\" or \"minerals.\" The answer is expected to be a noun phrase identifying an *object, concept, or thing*. It does not inherently ask for a quantity, date, definition, or location details, although the *value* aspect might imply a comparison or context.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- \"What is\": This introductory phrase typically seeks identification or definition.\n- \"most valuable resource\": This phrase is central. \"Resource\" is a key noun indicating an object or concept. \"Most valuable\" provides context or a specific attribute the resource possesses, but the core word is still \"resource,\" which points towards an entity. The question is asking *which* entity possesses this attribute within Nebraska.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because its primary objective is to identify a specific *thing* or *concept*. The word \"resource\" directly refers to an entity (something valuable that can be used). The question is asking for the identification of this particular entity (\"what is...?\") that holds the status of being the most valuable within Nebraska.

Therefore, the question type is one that requires a numerical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is a numerical output, such as an integer or a range (e.g., \"There is 1 species\" or \"There are approximately 5-6 species\"). The answer should be quantitative, meaning it deals with numbers, counts, or measurements, and not qualitative details. Characteristics include the use of words like \"how many,\" which signals a demand for a specific value, and the answer should be concise and factual, often derived from data or research. This contrasts with descriptive questions that might require lengthy explanations.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" which is a direct indicator of a quantity or count query. Additionally, \"species\" refers to a biological classification, but the question is not asking for a definition or description of species; it is specifically requesting a numerical attribute. Other phrases like \"of the great white shark\" provide context but do not change the core request for a number. These elements align with the C04 category, which is defined for questions involving numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"how many species of the great white shark are there ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a quantity or count. The phrase \"how many\" is a linguistic marker that directs the response toward a numerical answer, such as a specific number or estimate. This fits the category description for C04, which includes questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. While the subject (\"great white shark\") could fall under C01 (entity) if the question was about its characteristics, the focus here is on the numerical aspect of its classification. No other category fits: C02 (human) involves people, C03 (description) requires explanations, C05 (location) deals with places, and C06 (abbreviation) concerns acronyms. Thus, the question is inherently numeric due to its request for a count.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a numerical quantity, confirming its classification under C04. I am highly confident in this classification, as the key indicators (\"how many\" and the request for a count) are unambiguous and directly match the C04 category.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

It is not simply asking for a definition of what head lice are, but rather seeking an explanation of how they came to exist or spread. This indicates that the question is focused on providing detailed background information, which involves explaining a concept or phenomenon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as an explanation of the biological or evolutionary origin of head lice, including how they infest humans, their transmission methods, or historical context. This format suggests that the answer is not a simple fact (like a number or location), but rather a narrative or detailed explanation. The answer might include scientific details, making it explanatory in nature, which aligns with categories that require descriptive content.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"origin,\" which implies a request for historical, explanatory, or definitional information, and \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to seek descriptions or definitions. The phrase \"origin of head lice\" points to a need for detailed information about the cause or background of a specific entity (head lice). These elements suggest that the question is not focused on identifying a single fact (like a number or location) but rather on providing a comprehensive explanation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is the origin of head lice?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information about a specific concept. While \"head lice\" refers to an entity (C01), the question specifically targets its origin, which requires a descriptive response rather than a simple identification or fact-based answer. For instance, an answer might involve explaining that head lice are parasitic insects that originated from lice found on other animals and adapted to humans, or how they spread through close contact. This type of inquiry falls under \"description\" as defined by the category, which includes questions seeking explanations, definitions, or detailed information. It does not fit other categories: it's not about a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The focus on \"origin\" emphasizes the need for a descriptive explanation, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question explicitly seeks a descriptive explanation rather than a factual, numerical, locational, or categorical response."

It seeks to identify the particular bird species that was the first to be domesticated by humans. This indicates a request for information about a concrete thing, such as an animal or a specific entity, rather than a general concept, a person, a number, or a location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely to be a specific bird species or a descriptive name, such as \"chicken\" or \"red junglefowl,\" which are examples of entities. The answer format is typically a noun phrase or a short name, representing a distinct object or concept. It does not require a numerical value, a date, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description. The response is expected to be factual and point directly to an entity, without elaboration unless specified.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"first,\" \"domesticated,\" and \"bird.\" \"First\" suggests a question of primacy or sequence, but it does not change the core inquiry. \"Domesticated\" refers to a state or process, but the focus is on the bird itself. \"Bird\" is the central noun, indicating a specific type of animal. There are no words like \"how,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"who,\" or \"abbreviation\" that would point to other categories. The phrase \"what was\" is a standard interrogative for identifying entities, reinforcing that the question is about a particular thing.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what was the first domesticated bird?\" is asking for the identification of a specific bird species, which is a concrete entity. Category C01 (\"entity\") encompasses questions that seek information about specific objects, concepts, or things, such as animals, plants, or other tangible items. In this case, the bird is being treated as a distinct entity with historical significance, and the question is designed to elicit a name or type rather than a description, number, location, or abbreviation.

The key elements are the word \"when,\" which indicates a temporal inquiry, and the subject \"cnn begin broadcasting,\" which refers to an event in the history of a media organization. The information being requested is a date or time-related fact, such as a specific year, month, or day.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a numerical value or a date, such as \"June 1980\" or \"1980.\" This could include a year, month, and day, but the core is a measurement of time. The answer is expected to be factual and concise, often in a numeric form (e.g., a number representing a year or a specific date). It does not require a detailed explanation or narrative, as the focus is on retrieving a precise piece of information.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"when,\" \"begin,\" and \"broadcasting.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that often points to questions about time, dates, or events. \"Begin\" suggests an event with a starting point, and \"broadcasting\" refers to an activity. The phrase \"when did\" is a common structure for questions seeking temporal information. While \"cnn\" is an abbreviation for \"Cable News Network,\" which could relate to the C06 category (abbreviation), the question is not asking for its meaning; it's asking for a fact about its history. This helps rule out categories like C06.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"when did cnn begin broadcasting?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is asking for a specific date or numerical value related to an event. The category C04 encompasses questions that seek numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. In this case, the answer involves a temporal measurement—such as a year or a date—which is fundamentally numerical. For example, CNN began broadcasting on June 1980, and the year \"1980\" is a number, while the full date includes numerical components. \n\nThis classification fits because:\n- The question is not asking for a description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor is it focused on an entity itself (C01), a person (C02), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is directly requesting a fact that can be expressed numerically.\n- The word \"when\" reinforces the temporal aspect, which aligns with the numeric category as dates are a form of measurement.\n- In contrast, if the question were asking for CNN's purpose or details about its founders, it might fall under C03 (description), but here, the focus is on a specific time point.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly seeks a date or numerical value, which is consistent with the C04 category definition."

This could include cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, or temporal expressions like \"centuries\" or \"years.\" The answer is expected to be quantifiable and precise, fitting the nature of a numeric response. It does not require a narrative, definition, or qualitative description, but rather a factual, numerical piece of information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"when,\" which is a temporal indicator often associated with questions seeking dates or times. Additionally, \"flourish\" implies a period of activity or development, which is commonly expressed using numbers (e.g., centuries, decades). There are no words suggesting a focus on entities (like specific objects), humans (individuals or people), descriptions (explanations or definitions), locations (geographical places), or abbreviations (acronyms). This reinforces the idea that the question is seeking numerical information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"when did rococo painting and architecture flourish?\" directly asks for a time period, which is a classic example of a numeric query. Category C04 (numeric) encompasses questions that require numerical answers, including dates, quantities, measurements, or any form of numerical data. In this case, the answer would involve numbers (e.g., the 18th century, specific years like 1715-1775), which aligns perfectly with the definition of C04. \n- To contrast with other categories:\n  - It is not C01 (entity) because the question is not asking about a specific object or concept (e.g., \"what is Rococo?\"), but rather its temporal existence.\n  - It is not C02 (human) because it does not involve people or human figures.\n  - It is not C03 (description) because it does not seek an explanation or definition; it wants a factual time-based answer.\n  - It is not C05 (location) because there is no reference to places or spatial information.\n  - It is not C06 (abbreviation) because the question does not involve decoding or explaining an acronym.\n- Therefore, the question fits neatly into C04 due to its explicit request for a numerical time frame.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Based on the analysis, the question is confidently classified as C04, as it directly seeks numerical information about a historical period.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

This indicates that the core information being sought is related to a human being, as inventions are typically attributed to people. The question does not focus on the makeup itself but on the human inventor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer format is likely to be a proper noun or name of a person, such as \"Cleopatra\" or \"Susan Constantine,\" which are human entities. The answer may involve a single individual or a group, but it will not be a number, date, definition, or location. This suggests that the response is human-centric, emphasizing personal attribution rather than descriptive, quantitative, or spatial details.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words include \"who,\" which is a pronoun explicitly referring to a person, and \"invented,\" which implies an action performed by a human. The phrase \"make up\" refers to a concept or object, but the question is not about the object's properties or description; instead, it shifts the focus to the human inventor. These elements align with the C02 category, which deals with human-related information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question \"who invented make up ?\" directly asks for information about a person, specifically the inventor. This falls under the C02 category (\"human\") because it seeks human-related information, such as individuals, their roles, or actions. In contrast, it does not fit other categories: C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about the makeup itself or its characteristics; C03 (description) would be for explaining or defining makeup; C04 (numeric) for numbers or dates; C05 (location) for places; and C06 (abbreviation) for acronyms. Here, the focus is on identifying a human, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly uses \"who\" to refer to a person and the context clearly indicates a human inventor, aligning perfectly with the C02 category."

This phrasing suggests a query that requires selecting or identifying a specific individual from a list or set (implied by \"which of the following\") who holds the title of Rhodes Scholar. The Rhodes Scholar is a prestigious award given to students for study at the University of Oxford, and it is inherently tied to human achievements, such as notable figures in various fields who have received this scholarship. The question is not asking for a definition or a general fact but rather for the identification of a person, making it a human-related inquiry.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format involves naming or specifying a person, likely a proper noun (e.g., a name like \"Nelson Mandela\" or \"Bill Gates\"), as the question seeks to determine which individual from a given list was a Rhodes Scholar. This implies that the answer is not a number, date, location, or explanation but rather a reference to a human entity. The answer characteristics include being specific to an individual and potentially involving historical or contemporary figures associated with the Rhodes Scholarship.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"which of the following,\" which indicates a selection task from a predefined list, and \"rhodes scholar,\" which refers to a title or designation for people. The word \"was\" suggests a past or historical context, implying that the question is about identifying a person who has held this status. The term \"Rhodes Scholar\" is not an object, concept, or abbreviation but a human-centric title, aligning with the C02 category for human-related information. Phrases like \"which of the following\" often point to questions about people in multiple-choice scenarios.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"which of the following was rhodes scholar ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly seeks information about a specific individual or person. The Rhodes Scholarship is a human-centric award, and the question is asking which person from a list was honored with it, making it a query about people, individuals, or human-related information. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) could encompass people, but the description specifies \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" and while people are entities, C02 is more precise for questions focused on human identities and achievements.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, such as \"what is a Rhodes Scholar?\", but this question is not seeking a definition; it's asking for identification.\n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers or measurements, which are not relevant here.\n- C05 (location) concerns places or spatial information, absent in this query.\n- C06 (abbreviation) requires the meaning of acronyms, but \"Rhodes Scholar\" is not an abbreviation.\nThe core of the question is to identify a human being, as the Rhodes Scholar title is exclusively for individuals, not things or concepts. This focus on people aligns perfectly with the C02 category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly centered on identifying a person associated with the Rhodes Scholarship, which falls under the \"human\" category. I am highly confident in this classification, as it matches the given correct label and the question's intent.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

It may include details like who founded the team, its key members, and any historical context, but it should not be a simple numerical value, a date, or a location. The answer is expected to provide detailed information, making it explanatory or definitional in nature, rather than factual or quantitative.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases include \"who comprised,\" which directly asks for the composition or makeup of the team, and \"the now defunct comic book team known as the champions,\" which specifies a particular entity but shifts the focus to human-related information. Words like \"comprised\" suggest a need for descriptive details about the individuals, such as their identities and roles, rather than abstract concepts or physical objects. This aligns with categories that involve human elements or detailed explanations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C02 - description).\nThe question falls under category C02, \"description,\" because it is primarily seeking an explanation or detailed account of the team's composition. While the team itself is an entity (which could relate to C01), the specific wording \"who comprised\" emphasizes human elements, such as the individuals who made up the group. This requires a descriptive response that goes beyond simple identification; it involves providing context, such as who these people are, their contributions, or the team's history. For example, the answer might include names like \"Geoff Johns\" or \"Tom King\" if they were involved, along with brief descriptions of their roles. This contrasts with other categories: it's not asking for a number (C04), a location (C05), an abbreviation (C06), or a pure definition of an object (C01), but rather a narrative or explanatory description that involves human aspects.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly requests detailed information about the human components of a specific group, aligning with the definition of a description query."

The information being requested is not just a simple location name but a detailed explanation of how and why the breed originated, including possible geographical, cultural, or historical contexts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a descriptive, explanatory response rather than a short, factual one. For instance, an answer might include details such as the breed's roots in ancient Mexico, references to the Techichi dog, or the process of domestication and evolution. This suggests that the answer will be textual, narrative-driven, and may incorporate elements like dates, places, and historical facts, but the core focus is on providing a comprehensive description.

While \"where\" might suggest a spatial query, the phrase \"come from\" implies a broader inquiry into history, evolution, and context, which falls under the \"description\" category. This category encompasses questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed accounts, such as how something originated or developed. In contrast, C05 - location would be appropriate for a question like \"Where is the breed named 'chihuahua' from?\" if it were focused solely on a geographical pinpoint, but here the question demands a more nuanced response involving historical details.

This is a straightforward inquiry seeking the identity of a specific animal, namely the largest one. The core request is to identify or name the entity in question, which is a type of snake. It is not asking for subjective opinions, personal stories, or other types of information, but rather a factual identification of a particular thing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a noun or a noun phrase, such as the scientific or common name of the snake species (e.g., \"Reticulated Python\" or \"Green Anaconda\"). The answer may include brief descriptive elements if needed, but it is primarily focused on naming or identifying the entity. It does not require a numerical value, a date, a location, or an explanation of what the snake is; instead, it seeks a direct reference to the specific object. This contrasts with categories like C03 (description), which would expect a detailed explanation, or C04 (numeric), which would require a number.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"largest snake\" and \"in the world\". \"Snake\" is a specific object or thing, falling under the domain of entities. The word \"largest\" indicates a comparative aspect, but it still points to identifying a particular entity rather than asking for a quantity or measurement. The phrase \"what is\" is a common indicator for questions seeking identification or definition, which aligns with C01. There are no words suggesting a human, a location, a number, or an abbreviation, which would point to other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the largest snake in the world ?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for the identification of a specific object or concept—the largest snake. The category C01 is defined as questions that inquire about specific objects, concepts, or things, which directly matches this query. The snake in question is a tangible or conceptual entity, and the question seeks its name or identity, not a description, number, location, or abbreviation. For example, if the question were \"What is the length of the largest snake?\" it would fall under C04 (numeric), but here, it is focused on the entity itself. The use of \"what is\" reinforces the need for identification, and the context (\"in the world\") provides scope but does not alter the core request for an entity. This classification ensures that the answer is about a thing, not a person, place, or abstract concept like a definition.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, I am highly confident that this question should be classified as C01, as it aligns perfectly with the category description for questions about specific objects or things.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

    "text": "how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?",
    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?\". This is an inquiry about a financial aspect of a legal matter. Specifically, it is asking for the monetary value associated with a back injury lawsuit, such as potential settlements, damages awarded, or costs involved. The information being requested is a numerical amount, indicating that the answer should quantify the financial outcome in some way, like dollars or a comparable unit.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a numerical value, such as a specific dollar amount, a range (e.g., \"between $10,000 and $500,000\"), or an average statistic. It could also include units like \"dollars\" or \"USD\" to provide context. The characteristics of the answer are that it must be measurable and expressible in numbers, rather than being descriptive, categorical, or qualitative. For instance, if the answer were \"it depends on the case,\" it might still involve numbers (e.g., \"cases range from X to Y\"), but the core request is for a quantifiable output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"how much money\" and \"back injury lawsuit.\" \"How much money\" is a direct and explicit indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value. \"Back injury lawsuit\" provides context but does not change the core request; it specifies the domain (legal or medical) but the focus remains on the monetary aspect. Other potential keywords include \"get,\" which implies receiving or obtaining a sum, reinforcing the numeric nature. In contrast, there are no words suggesting a description (e.g., \"what is a back injury lawsuit?\"), a location (e.g., \"where does this happen?\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does BL stand for?\").\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?\" should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity related to money. The phrase \"how much money\" is a clear signal that the expected response involves numbers, such as amounts, sums, or statistics. This aligns with the definition of C04, which encompasses questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. In this case, the quantity is specifically financial, but the category includes all types of numerical data.\n\n- **Why not other categories?**\n  - **C01 (entity):** This category is for questions about specific objects or concepts, such as \"What is a back injury lawsuit?\" The question here is not asking for information about the lawsuit itself but rather a monetary value, so it doesn't fit.\n  - **C02 (human):** This category involves people or human-related topics, like \"Who was involved in the lawsuit?\" The question focuses on money, not individuals, so it doesn't apply.\n  - **C03 (description):** This category is for explanatory or definitional questions, such as \"Explain back injury lawsuits.\" The question is not seeking a detailed explanation but a specific number, so it doesn't match.\n  - **C05 (location):** This category deals with places or spatial information, like \"Where are back injury lawsuits filed?\" The question is about money, not geography, so it's irrelevant.\n  - **C06 (abbreviation):** This category is for meanings of abbreviations, such as \"What does BL stand for?\" The question has no abbreviations and is not about acronyms, so it doesn't fit.\n\nThe question's focus on \"how much money\" makes it inherently numeric, as the answer would typically involve a numerical figure or range, which is the defining characteristic of C04.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct because the question directly uses the phrase \"how much money,\" which unambiguously requests a numerical quantity, and the context of a lawsuit does not alter this requirement for a numeric response."

    "text": "what ' s the common name for acetylsalicylic acid ?",
    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what ' s the common name for acetylsalicylic acid ?\". This query is seeking an alternative or familiar name for the chemical compound acetylsalicylic acid. The core request is for information about a specific substance, which is a defined entity in the context of chemistry or pharmacology. It is not inquiring about a person, a place, a numerical value, or an abbreviation, but rather about the identity or nomenclature of an object or concept.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a word or phrase, such as \"aspirin\", which is the common name for acetylsalicylic acid. This format suggests a direct response providing a label or identifier for the entity in question. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description; it is concise and factual, focusing on naming or identification. This aligns with categories that deal with specific things or concepts, rather than abstract explanations or measurements.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"what ' s the common name\" and \"for acetylsalicylic acid\". The phrase \"common name\" indicates a request for a synonym or everyday term, which points to a question about an entity's identity. \"Acetylsalicylic acid\" is a specific term referring to a chemical compound, which is an example of an entity. Other potential keywords like \"common name\" might suggest a descriptive element, but in this context, it is directly tied to identifying a thing rather than explaining it. There are no words indicating human involvement, location, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for the common name of a specific chemical substance, acetylsalicylic acid. An entity category encompasses questions about particular objects, concepts, or things, such as chemicals, drugs, or other defined items. Here, acetylsalicylic acid is a concrete entity—a chemical compound with a recognized identity. The question is not seeking a definition, explanation, or description (which would fall under C03), nor is it asking for a number, date, or quantity (C04), a geographical location (C05), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is directly requesting a name or identifier for this entity, which is a typical characteristic of C01 questions. For instance, similar questions might include \"what is the chemical formula for water?\" or \"what is the function of mitochondria?\", both of which classify as entities because they focus on specific things. In this case, the query is straightforwardly about the nomenclature of a chemical entity, reinforcing the classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question clearly targets a specific chemical entity without any ambiguity or overlap with other categories."

This query begins with \"what does\" and includes the word \"mean\", which are key indicators that the user is seeking an explanation or definition. The term \"hoya\" is enclosed in backticks, suggesting it is a specific term, likely an acronym or slang, that needs clarification. The context includes \"georgetown\", which may refer to Georgetown University, implying that \"hoya\" is a term associated with that institution, such as a mascot or nickname. Overall, the question is requesting detailed information about the meaning, usage, or significance of \"hoya\" in this context, rather than a simple fact or data point.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a descriptive response, such as a definition, explanation, or detailed breakdown of what \"hoya\" signifies. For example, the answer might explain that \"Hoya\" is the mascot of Georgetown University, known for its eagle symbolism, or it could provide historical or cultural context. The characteristics of the expected answer include being explanatory, potentially involving examples or background information, and not necessarily numerical or factual in nature. This contrasts with formats that require specific numbers, locations, or concise definitions without elaboration.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what does\" and \"mean\", which are strong signals for a descriptive or explanatory query. The use of backticks around \"hoya\" emphasizes that it is a term being defined or explained, and the reference to \"georgetown\" provides context but does not shift the focus away from seeking meaning. These elements align with the category C03 description, as they indicate a need for detailed information rather than a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation alone. There is no direct reference to a number, date, or measurement, nor is it focused on a human or location exclusively.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (description) because it is explicitly asking for an explanation or definition of a term, which falls under the category's scope of \"questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information.\" Here, \"what does ... mean\" is a classic phrasing for seeking descriptive content, such as the meaning, origin, or usage of \"hoya\" in the context of Georgetown. While \"hoya\" could be an abbreviation (potentially related to C06), the question is not directly asking for its expansion or acronym definition; instead, it seeks a broader explanation, making C03 more appropriate. The mention of \"georgetown\" adds context but does not change the core request for descriptive information. This classification aligns with the category description, as opposed to C01 (entity), which would be for questions about specific things like \"what is Georgetown University?\", or C06 (abbreviation), which would be for \"what does Hoya stand for?\".\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct because the question's structure and phrasing clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, which matches the definition of C03, while other categories do not fit due to the absence of numerical, locational, or purely abbreviatory focus."

It may include details about accessibility or specific resources, but the core is the locational aspect.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"where can I find,\" which is a direct indicator of a location-based query. The word \"location\" is implied, and the subject matter (finding a list of books) does not change the category focus. Other elements like \"classic books\" and \"5th and 6th graders\" provide context but do not alter the core request for a place. No words suggest a numeric, descriptive, or abbreviatory need.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the place or source where information can be found, which aligns with the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" The phrase \"where can I find\" is a strong signal for this category, as it seeks spatial or locational details. While the question involves books, it is not about the books as an entity (C01), people (C02), explanation (C03), numbers (C04), or abbreviations (C06).

The core request is for the date or period when this event occurred, which implies a need for temporal information. The question does not seek an explanation, definition, or other details; it is focused on retrieving a factual piece of information related to a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question would typically be a date, year, or numerical value, such as \"February 28, 1789\" or \"in 1789.\" This format involves numbers or specific measurements of time, indicating that the answer is quantitative and precise. Characteristics include the use of numerical data (e.g., years, months, days) or a direct reference to a number, which aligns with the need for a factual, data-driven response rather than descriptive or qualitative information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"when\" and \"take place.\" \"When\" is a direct indicator of a time-related query, often seeking a date or numerical timestamp. \"Take place\" reinforces the idea of an event occurring at a specific time. The phrase \"the bounty mutiny\" refers to a historical event, but the question is not about its nature or description; it is specifically asking for the time of occurrence. No other categories are hinted at, as there are no words suggesting a person, location, description, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"when did the bounty mutiny take place ?\" falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical or date-based response. The word \"when\" is a strong signal for time-related queries, and the Bounty mutiny is a well-documented historical event that occurred at a specific time (in this case, in 1789).

It is not asking for a person, a definition, a number, a location, or an abbreviation. Instead, it seeks the name or title of a particular literary work, which is an entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer is likely to be a specific title or name of a novel, such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick. This answer is a proper noun or a concept, not a numerical value, a date, a geographical location, or an explanation. The response format is typically a short phrase or sentence naming the entity, without requiring additional details or calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"novel\", which refers to a specific object or concept (a book), and \"inspired\", which indicates a relationship but does not change the core request for an entity. The phrase \"movie bladerunner\" specifies a particular thing (the film), but the question is centered on the novel as the entity in question.

A novel is a tangible or abstract thing, such as a literary work, which fits the definition of an entity. This is not a human-related question (C02), as no individual is mentioned or focused on. It is not a description (C03), since it does not ask for an explanation or definition of the novel or movie. It is not numeric (C04), as it does not seek numbers, dates, or quantities. It is not location-based (C05), as no place is involved. Finally, it is not an abbreviation (C06), as there is no acronym or short form being queried. The question directly requests information about a particular thing, making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question clearly seeks a specific entity (a novel) and aligns with the C01 category definition."

This is a direct inquiry that seeks an explanation or definition of the term \"transistor\". It is not asking for a specific instance, such as a particular transistor device, or a quantity, but rather the conceptual understanding of what a transistor is. The information requested includes details about its function, characteristics, history, or applications, which are all descriptive in nature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a detailed, explanatory response, such as a definition, explanation, or overview of the concept. It may include technical details, examples, or comparisons, but it is not expected to be a single number, date, or short fact. The answer should be narrative in style, providing comprehensive information rather than a concise or numerical output. This aligns with categories that involve descriptive or explanatory content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a common indicator of descriptive questions, as it prompts for definitions or explanations. The term \"transistor\" refers to a specific concept in electronics, but the question is not focused on identifying an entity (like a physical object) or a human-related aspect. There are no numerical indicators (e.g., numbers or dates), location references, or abbreviations present. The phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a request for detailed information, which is characteristic of the description category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is a transistor ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition of a concept. Transistors are electronic components, and the question seeks detailed information about their nature, operation, and significance, which falls under the description category. This is evident from the use of the phrase \"what is\", which typically indicates a need for elucidation rather than identification of a specific entity, quantity, location, or abbreviation. For instance, if the question were asking for the location of a transistor's invention or a numerical value like its size, it would fit a different category (e.g., C05 or C04). However, here, the focus is on providing a comprehensive description, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question clearly fits the description category due to its request for explanatory information. I am highly confident in this classification, as it aligns perfectly with the category definitions and the question's intent.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The core request is for identification and listing of these entities, rather than seeking a numerical value, a definition, or a location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format involves providing a list or description of specific elements, such as \"oxygen, silicon, aluminum, etc.\" This is typically a set of named objects or concepts, which suggests a descriptive or informational response focused on entities. It does not require a numerical output, a date, or a spatial description, but rather a clear identification of what those elements are.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"elements,\" which refers to specific chemical entities, and \"earth ' s crust,\" which is a concept or thing. The phrase \"most common\" indicates a selection or ranking of entities, but the primary action is \"are,\" which seeks to identify or describe these entities. There are no words suggesting human involvement, numerical data, location, or abbreviation, which helps narrow down the category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about specific objects or concepts—the elements that make up the Earth's crust. Elements are tangible or abstract entities in the context of chemistry, and the question is focused on identifying and listing them, which aligns with the definition of C01. It is not a human-related question (C02), as it does not involve people or individuals. It is not a description question (C03), though it might involve some explanation of what elements are, but the main request is for the entities themselves. It is not numeric (C04), as it does not ask for quantities or measurements (e.g., percentages or ranks). It is not location-based (C05), as it is not inquiring about places or spatial information.

The core request is for a price, which is a quantitative measure, rather than qualitative information about the tent itself.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a numerical value, such as a dollar amount (e.g., \"$40\" or \"approximately $60\"), a range of numbers, or a specific quantity like \"around $50.\" The answer should be a number or a set of numbers, not a descriptive text, definition, or other non-numeric format. This aligns with the nature of cost inquiries, which are inherently quantitative.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"how much,\" which directly implies a request for a quantity or price. The word \"cost\" reinforces this by explicitly referring to a monetary value. Additionally, the phrase \"2 foot square\" provides a measurement, which is numeric, and \"with sides\" adds detail about the tent but does not alter the primary focus on cost. These elements collectively point to a question seeking numerical information, as opposed to descriptive, locational, or other categorical data.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical value—the cost of the tent. Cost is a type of quantity that is typically expressed in numbers, such as currency units (e.g., dollars, euros), and often involves calculations or estimations based on size or features. While the question mentions the tent's dimensions (\"2 foot square\"), this is secondary and provides context for the cost query but does not shift the focus to a descriptive or entity-based question. The category C04 encompasses questions that require numerical answers, including those involving quantities, measurements, or prices. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about the tent itself as an object; C02 (human) is irrelevant as no people are involved; C03 (description) would require an explanation or definition, which is not requested; C05 (location) is unrelated to places; and C06 (abbreviation) does not involve any acronym or initialism. Thus, the primary intent for a numeric response confirms C04.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification, as the question's core request for a cost aligns perfectly with the definition of C04, which involves seeking numerical quantities."

These words align with the \"description\" category, as they indicate a need for detailed, explanatory content rather than a specific type of data like a number or location.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question is asking for the origin of a word, which directly seeks an explanation or definition of its beginnings. This falls under the \"description\" category (C03) because it requires providing detailed information, such as the word's history, etymology, or how it was formed. Unlike a \"numeric\" question that would ask for a quantity or date, or a \"location\" question that would inquire about a place, this question focuses on the word itself and its development, making it descriptive in nature. Even if \"jj\" is an abbreviation, the core inquiry about its origin still fits the description category, as it involves explaining the word's meaning or history rather than just defining it.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High, as the question explicitly asks for the origin, which necessitates a descriptive response, aligning perfectly with the C03 category."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\nThe question is: \"how many hostages were killed in the entebbe raid?\" This question is requesting a specific quantity or count related to a historical event. The core focus is on obtaining a numerical value, such as the number of hostages killed, rather than seeking detailed information about the event itself, the people involved, or the location. The phrase \"how many\" is a direct indicator that the answer should be a number or a specific measurement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is numerical. It should be a specific number, such as an integer (e.g., \"39\" or \"approximately 40\"), or possibly a date if the context involved a timeline, but in this case, the question is explicitly about the number killed. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or other formats; it is purely quantitative. This aligns with categories that deal with numerical data, as opposed to qualitative or categorical information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words in the question include \"how many,\" which is a strong indicator of a numeric question. This phrase is commonly used when seeking quantities, counts, or measurements. Other elements like \"hostages\" and \"entebbe raid\" provide context but do not change the fundamental request for a number. \"Hostages\" could relate to a human or entity category if the question focused on individuals, but here it is used in a quantitative sense. \"Entebbe raid\" refers to a specific event, but the question is not asking for its description, location, or abbreviations; it is focused on the numerical outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a numerical value. The word \"how many\" is a clear signal that the expected response is a count or quantity, which falls under the numeric category. While the question mentions \"hostages\" (which could imply human-related information) and \"entebbe raid\" (which might suggest a location or event), the primary intent is to obtain a specific number, not to describe people, places, or concepts. This is not a description question because it does not seek an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what was the Entebbe raid?\"). It is not a location question because the focus is on the number killed, not the geographical details. It is not an abbreviation question as there is no acronym or short form involved. Finally, it is not an entity or human question because it is not inquiring about specific objects, concepts, or individuals but rather a quantifiable aspect of an event. Therefore, the question fits squarely into the numeric category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question explicitly requests a numerical answer, and the category C04 is designed for such queries."

This is an inquiry about methods or strategies to increase one's intelligence quotient (IQ). It is not seeking a specific fact, a numerical value, or a location, but rather an explanation of actions or processes that could lead to raising IQ.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format would involve a descriptive response, such as a list of tips, steps, or explanations of cognitive activities that might improve IQ. For example, the answer might include details on education, brain training exercises, or lifestyle changes. This format is explanatory and non-numeric, focusing on providing detailed information rather than a simple fact or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how\" and \"raise\". \"How\" typically indicates a request for a method, process, or explanation, while \"raise\" suggests an action to increase something. The term \"iq\" refers to a concept (intelligence quotient), which is not an abbreviation, entity, or location. These elements point toward a question that seeks detailed information or a description of a process.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how you can raise your iq ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information on how to achieve a specific outcome. It does not fit other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because it is not inquiring about a specific object or concept like \"what is IQ?\" but rather about how to change it.\n- It is not C02 (human) because, while IQ is related to humans, the question focuses on the method of raising IQ, not on people or individuals.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because there is no request for numbers, dates, or quantities (e.g., \"what is the average IQ?\" or \"what score do you need?\").\n- It is not C05 (location) because there is no reference to places or spatial information.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because \"iq\" is not an acronym or abbreviation being asked to be explained; it is a full term (though often abbreviated, the question does not focus on its meaning).\n\nInstead, the question explicitly uses \"how\" to request a descriptive answer, which aligns with C03, as it seeks to explain or define a process for achieving a goal.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a detailed explanation or description of how to raise IQ, which matches the definition of C03. I am confident in this classification as it logically follows the question's intent and structure.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

This is requesting the meaning or expansion of the term \"inri\", which is presented in uppercase letters, suggesting it is an acronym or abbreviation. The context specifies that it is used on Jesus' cross, but the core request is to define or explain what \"inri\" represents. This indicates a focus on decoding a specific term rather than seeking general knowledge about objects, people, or events.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a concise definition or expansion of the abbreviation, such as providing the full phrase that \"inri\" stands for (e.g., \"Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum\"). The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed narrative, or spatial details. Instead, it is a straightforward explanation that directly addresses the abbreviation's meaning, which aligns with questions seeking clarification of acronyms.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases include \"what does inri stand for\", which is a direct query for the meaning of an abbreviation. The term \"inri\" is capitalized and typically recognized as an acronym, especially in historical or religious contexts like Jesus' cross. The word \"abbreviation\" is not explicitly stated, but the phrasing \"stand for\" is a common indicator for such questions. The context \"when used on jesus ' cross\" provides background but does not alter the fundamental request for abbreviation meaning.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C06 (abbreviation) because it explicitly asks for the meaning of \"inri\", which is an acronym. Acronyms like \"inri\" are formed from initial letters and require expansion to understand their full form. In this case, \"inri\" stands for \"Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum\", a Latin phrase related to the inscription on Jesus' cross. This type of question is not about identifying a specific entity (C01), a person (C02), a detailed description (C03), a number (C04), or a location (C05). Instead, it centers on decoding an abbreviation, which is precisely the focus of C06. The use of \"what does ... stand for\" is a hallmark of abbreviation-related queries, making the classification clear and consistent with the category description.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C06  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly seeks the meaning of an acronym, and the provided context does not introduce elements that would shift it to another category."

The word \"who\" is a key indicator, as it typically requests information about people, groups, or organizations, rather than objects, concepts, or physical locations. This suggests the question is seeking human-related information, such as a company, individual, or human-driven process.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a name, a company, or a descriptive phrase referring to a human or organizational actor. For example, responses might include \"Italian winemakers\" or \"specific brands like Martini & Rossi.\" The answer does not require a numerical value, a date, a detailed explanation, or a location-based description. Instead, it calls for an identification of the producer, which is inherently tied to human or human-like entities (e.g., companies, regions known for human production). This aligns with questions that focus on people or human involvement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"who,\" \"produces,\" and \"spumante.\" \"Who\" is a pronoun that directly points to human subjects, such as individuals or groups. \"Produces\" is a verb that implies human agency or organizational action, as it describes an activity typically performed by people or entities. \"Spumante\" is the object of the query, but it does not change the core focus on the producer. These words align with the C02 category, which emphasizes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, words like \"what,\" \"where,\" or \"how\" might suggest other categories (e.g., entity or location), but \"who\" specifically narrows it to human elements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who produces spumante?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly asks for the producer of a product, which is inherently human-centric. The use of \"who\" indicates a request for information about people, organizations, or human-driven processes, rather than abstract concepts, locations, or numerical data. For instance, if the question were \"what is spumante?\" it might fall under C03 (description), but here, the focus is on the producer. Similarly, if it asked \"where is spumante produced?\" it could be C05 (location), but the word \"who\" shifts the emphasis to the human or organizational actor. This classification fits the category description for C02, which includes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, as spumante production involves human labor, companies, or regions known for winemaking expertise. The answer would not be a number (C04), a definition (C03), or a place (C05), but rather an entity like a person, company, or group.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and keywords clearly point to human-related information, and the classification aligns with the provided correct label."

The core request is for the name or names of the individual(s) credited with the discovery of electricity. This implies a focus on human figures, as electricity discovery is commonly associated with specific historical or scientific individuals, such as figures like Benjamin Franklin or Michael Faraday. The question does not seek abstract concepts, objects, or other types of information but rather targets a human subject.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a proper noun or a descriptive phrase identifying a person, such as \"Benjamin Franklin\" or \"a group of scientists.\" It may involve a single name or a brief explanation, but the primary output is human-centric, focusing on an individual or individuals.

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what album put the Beatles on the cover of Time in 1967?\" This is inquiring about a specific musical album that was featured on the cover of the Time magazine in the year 1967. The information being requested is the name or title of that particular album, which is a concrete object or concept related to music. The focus is on identifying a specific thing, rather than asking about people, places, or abstract details.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely to be a specific album title, such as \"The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'\" or a similar name. This answer is a noun phrase or a proper name, indicating a thing or object. It is not expected to be a number, date, or descriptive text, but rather a concise reference to an entity. The answer format suggests a direct identification of an existing item, which aligns with categories that deal with specific objects or concepts.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"album\": This directly refers to a physical or digital collection of music, which is an object or concept.\n- \"Beatles\": While this refers to a human group, the question is not centered on them; it's about the album associated with them.\n- \"cover of Time\": This refers to a publication, but the question is not asking about the publication itself; it's using it as context to identify the album.\n- \"1967\": This is a date, but it's provided as contextual information and not the main focus of the question.\n\nThese elements point to the question seeking a specific thing (the album), which is characteristic of the C01 category (entity). The word \"album\" is a strong indicator, as it denotes a tangible or abstract entity in the context of music.\n\n#### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or concept—the album that featured the Beatles on the cover of Time magazine in 1967. An entity category encompasses questions that request information about particular things, such as objects, events, or concepts, rather than people, descriptions, numbers, locations, or abbreviations. In this case:\n- The core of the question is the identification of an album, which is a defined entity in the domain of music.\n- The mention of \"Beatles\" and \"Time\" provides context but does not shift the focus to human-related (C02) or location-related (C05) topics. The Beatles are the subject, but the question is not about their biography or attributes; it's about the album.\n- It is not a description (C03) because it doesn't ask for an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what is an album?\").\n- It is not numeric (C04) because while the year \"1967\" is included, the question isn't asking for a number or quantity; it's using it to specify the event.\n- It is not location (C05) as there is no reference to a place or spatial information.\n- It is not abbreviation (C06) since no acronym or shortened form is involved.\n\nThus, the question is seeking a specific entity (the album), making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n#### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nI am highly confident that the classification is C01, as the question directly asks for a specific album, which aligns with the definition of an entity.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"what is the busiest air travel season?\" is inquiring about a specific time period or event in air travel characterized by high activity. It seeks to identify the season with the most air traffic, which could involve understanding peak travel times, such as summer or winter holidays. The core request is for a temporal or seasonal designation, but it implies a need for data-driven information to determine the busiest period.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer typically involves a specific season or time frame, such as \"summer\" or \"northern hemisphere winter,\" but it often comes with supporting numerical data. For example, responses might include statistics on passenger numbers, flight counts, or date ranges to justify why one season is busier than others. The answer format could be descriptive (e.g., \"December to March\"), but it frequently incorporates quantitative elements like dates or numbers to provide a complete picture. This aligns with the characteristics of a numeric question, as the busiest season is often determined through measurements of traffic volume.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"busiest,\" which implies high volume or intensity, and \"season,\" which refers to a period. These words suggest a focus on quantifiable aspects, such as comparing numerical data across different seasons to identify the peak one. The phrase \"air travel season\" is a common term in contexts where travel statistics are discussed, often involving numerical metrics like passenger loads or seasonal averages. This points toward a category that deals with numbers or measurements, even if the direct answer is a descriptive term.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is the busiest air travel season?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it inherently seeks information that is defined or determined by numerical data. While the surface-level request is for a seasonal period, the concept of \"busiest\" relies on quantitative comparisons, such as the number of passengers, flights, or revenue generated during different times of the year. For instance, industry reports often use numerical figures to identify the busiest seasons, like the holiday period with the highest traffic. Even if the answer is a simple season name, the underlying information is frequently numerical, making this a numeric question. The category C04 encompasses questions that ask for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements, and this question fits because it prompts the retrieval or calculation of such data to answer the query accurately.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly relates to quantifiable aspects of air travel demand, which are standard in numeric classifications."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"which Japanese car maker had its biggest percentage of sale in the domestic market?\" This is inquiring about a specific Japanese car manufacturer and the fact that it achieved the highest market share in its home market. The request is not simply for a list or identification of car makers but focuses on a particular event or attribute—namely, the one with the biggest percentage of sales. This indicates that the question is seeking information about a specific instance or detail related to the car maker.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer likely involves naming a specific car maker (e.g., Toyota or Honda) and may include additional details such as the percentage of sales or the year this occurred. However, the primary format is descriptive, as it requires explaining or detailing which car maker fits this criterion. The answer might involve a narrative or factual explanation rather than just a numerical value or a simple entity name. This suggests the answer is not purely numeric but could incorporate quantitative data as part of a broader description.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"which,\" \"Japanese car maker,\" \"biggest percentage of sale,\" and \"domestic market.\"  \n- \"which\" implies a search for a specific entity or fact.  \n- \"Japanese car maker\" refers to an entity (a company), but the question is not defining what a car maker is; it's applying a condition to it.  \n- \"biggest percentage of sale\" involves a comparison and a numerical concept, but it's not the focus; the question is about identifying the car maker that achieved this.  \n- \"domestic market\" provides context but does not shift the category toward location-focused questions.  \nThese keywords point to a question that seeks detailed information about a particular achievement or event, rather than just a definition, number, or location.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a specific fact related to Japanese car makers. While it involves identifying an entity (a car maker), the core request is not to define what a car maker is (which would be C01) but to describe which one had the highest market share, potentially requiring contextual details such as historical data, comparisons, or reasons behind the achievement. This aligns with the C02 category description, which includes questions that seek explanations or detailed information. For example, answering this question might involve stating the car maker and providing the percentage or timeframe, making it descriptive rather than purely identifying or numeric. It does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not about the general concept of car makers; it's about a specific instance. It also doesn't fit C04 (numeric) because while numbers might be involved, the primary focus is on the descriptive aspect of \"which\" car maker. The question is not about people (C02 human), locations (C05 location), or abbreviations (C06 abbreviation), as there is no human element, spatial focus, or acronym involved.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly seeks detailed information about a specific achievement, which is characteristic of the description category."

This is a direct inquiry about a specific individual holding a position of authority in a given location. The core request is for information about a person, namely the current or relevant mayor, which implies seeking details such as their name, role, or background. The mention of \"Marbella\" provides context by specifying the location, but the primary focus is on identifying a human being rather than an object, concept, or other entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer typically involves a proper noun or a descriptive phrase referring to a human individual. For instance, a response might be \"The mayor of Marbella is [Name]\" or a brief description of the person. The answer format is not numerical, explanatory in detail, or focused on a place; instead, it is centered on human-related information, such as names, titles, or personal attributes. This suggests the answer will be concise and directly tied to a person, rather than requiring calculations, definitions, or spatial data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"who\", \"mayor\", and \"Marbella\". \"Who\" is a pronoun specifically used to ask about people or entities, but in this context, it strongly points to human-related information. \"Mayor\" is a title that denotes a human position of authority, further emphasizing the focus on individuals. \"Marbella\" is a geographical location, but it serves as a modifier that specifies the context without shifting the question's primary intent. These elements collectively indicate that the question is seeking information about a person, aligning with the C02 category for human-related inquiries.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who is the mayor of marbella ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking about a specific individual or human being. The word \"who\" directly queries for personal identity, and \"mayor\" refers to a human role, making the question centered on people rather than objects, concepts, or places. While \"Marbella\" is a location, it does not change the classification, as the question is not primarily about the place itself (which would be C05) but about the human associated with it. This aligns with the C02 category description: questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, other categories do not fit: C01 (entity) is broader and could include people, but C02 is the more precise category for human-focused questions; C03 (description) involves explanations, which is not the case here; C04 (numeric) deals with numbers, absent in this query; and C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant as no abbreviations are present. Thus, the question is clearly human-oriented.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is confidently classified under C02, as it directly seeks information about a person, with high confidence due to the clear use of \"who\" and the human-centric nature of the query.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

The core request is for a temporal piece of information—specifically, the year when she assumed the position of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The question focuses on an event in her life, but the essential information being sought is a numerical value representing a point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question is a numerical value, such as a four-digit year (e.g., 1979). It is likely to be a simple, precise number or a range, but in this context, it is typically a single year. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or qualitative details; it is straightforward and quantitative. This aligns with questions that demand factual data, often found in databases or historical records, where the response is a number rather than a narrative.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nThe question contains several key words and phrases that directly point to the category:\n\n- \"year\": This word explicitly indicates a temporal concept, which falls under numeric information, as years are numerical representations of time.\n- \"become prime minister\": This phrase describes an event, but it is not the focus; the question is specifically asking for the year of this event, which is a numerical attribute.\n- \"thatcher\": This is a proper noun referring to a person, but the question is not centered on the person themselves (which would fit C02 - human) or their description (C03 - description). Instead, it is querying a specific fact about them.\n\nOther categories do not fit:\n- C01 (entity) involves objects or concepts, but the question is not about defining or identifying an entity.\n- C02 (human) would be appropriate if the question was about Margaret Thatcher herself, such as \"Who is Margaret Thatcher?\" or \"What are her achievements?\" but here, the focus is on the year.\n- C03 (description) requires detailed explanations or definitions, which is not the case here.\n- C05 (location) involves geographical places, which is irrelevant.\n- C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms or shortened forms, which is not present.\n\nThe presence of \"year\" strongly suggests a numeric category, as it implies a request for a number.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"in what year did thatcher become prime minister ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical value. The word \"year\" directly indicates that the answer is expected to be a number, specifically a date in the Gregorian calendar. This type of question seeks quantitative information, such as a specific year, which is a common example of a numeric query. \n\nIn contrast, other categories do not align:\n- C01 (entity) is for questions about objects or concepts, like \"What is climate change?\" but this question is not asking for a definition or explanation.\n- C02 (human) is for questions about people, such as \"Who was the first female president?\" but while \"thatcher\" refers to a human, the question is not about her identity or life story; it's about a specific event in time.\n- C03 (description) involves detailed information or explanations, like \"Describe the Industrial Revolution,\" but this question expects a concise numerical answer.\n- C05 (location) is for spatial information, such as \"Where is the Eiffel Tower?\" which is not relevant.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is for meanings of acronyms, like \"What does AI stand for?\" which is absent here.\n\nThe question's structure—asking for a \"year\"—makes it clear that the response will be a number, fitting the C04 category perfectly. This classification is based on the standard definition of numeric questions, which include inquiries about dates, years, or other numerical data.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the question belongs to category C04, as the explicit request for a year ensures a numerical answer, and the analysis of key words and question type confirms this classification.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

It is requesting a numerical value that represents the duration of the moon's orbital period around Earth, measured in months. The core of the question is to obtain a count or measurement, rather than to identify a concept, explain a definition, or discuss a location.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a numerical value, such as a number followed by a unit (e.g., \"about 27 days\" or \"one month,\" though the latter might be approximate). The question specifies \"months,\" so the answer should be in terms of a quantity that can be counted or measured. This suggests a response that is quantitative, possibly involving a specific number, a range, or a calculation. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or other non-numeric elements, as the focus is on providing a precise or approximate numerical figure.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"how many\": This is a direct interrogative that typically signals a request for a numerical count or quantity.\n- \"months\": This is a unit of time, which is a measurable quantity and reinforces the need for a numerical answer.\n- \"does it take\": This phrase is commonly used in questions about time, duration, or measurements.\n- \"revolve around the earth\": This describes a scientific or astronomical concept, but it does not change the fundamental request for a numerical value; it simply provides context for what the quantity represents.\n\nThese elements collectively point toward a category that involves seeking numerical information, as opposed to other types like definitions or locations.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how many months does it take the moon to revolve around the earth?\" should be classified under category C04 - numeric because it explicitly asks for a numerical value related to a measurement or quantity. The word \"how many\" is a strong indicator of a numeric question, as it directly seeks a count or numerical estimate. Additionally, the unit \"months\" specifies that the answer must be in terms of time, which is a common type of measurement in numeric questions. The question does not ask for an explanation, definition, or description of the moon's revolution; it is purely seeking a number. \n\nIn contrast:\n- It does not fit C01 (entity) because while it mentions the moon and Earth, it is not asking about their nature or identity but rather a property (orbital period).\n- It does not fit C02 (human) as there is no reference to people or human activities.\n- It does not fit C03 (description) because it is not requesting an explanation or detailed information; it is focused on a specific numerical answer.\n- It does not fit C05 (location) as it is not about places or spatial coordinates.\n- It does not fit C06 (abbreviation) as there are no abbreviations or acronyms involved.\n\nTherefore, the question aligns perfectly with the definition of C04 - numeric, which encompasses inquiries about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the clear request for a numerical quantity and the absence of any indicators for other categories."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"who sings the themes for ` ` dawson ' s creek ' ' and ` ` felicity ' ' ?\" This query is asking about the performers of specific musical themes associated with two television shows, \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"Felicity\". The key phrase \"who sings\" indicates a request for information about individuals or groups of people involved in singing. The question is focused on identifying human agents (the singers) rather than the themes themselves or other attributes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves naming specific people or entities (e.g., individual singers, bands, or voice actors). For instance, the response might include names like \"John Doe\" or \"The Show Theme Band\". This suggests a direct reference to human-related information, such as names, roles, or credentials, rather than numerical data, definitions, or explanations. The answer does not require a quantity, date, or detailed explanation, but simply identifies the human performers.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe phrase \"who sings\" is a direct indicator of a human-related query, as it specifically asks for information about people. Other key elements include the mention of TV shows, but these are contextual and serve as the subject of the inquiry. The double backticks around the show names might be a formatting error, but they do not change the core intent of the question, which remains focused on the singers. No words or phrases suggest categories like numbers, locations, abbreviations, or descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for information about people. The word \"who\" directly points to a query about individuals or groups, and the context involves musical performances by humans. While the TV shows mentioned (\"Dawson's Creek\" and \"Felicity\") are entities (which could fall under C01), the question is not about the shows themselves but about the human actors involved in singing their themes. This aligns with the C02 category description: \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" \n\n- It is not C01 (entity) because the focus is on the people (singers) rather than the shows or themes as objects or concepts.\n- It is not C03 (description) because the question does not seek an explanation or definition; it asks for specific identities.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numerical data (e.g., song counts or dates) is requested.\n- It is not C05 (location) because no geographical or spatial information is involved.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because no abbreviations are mentioned or inquired about.\n\nThus, the question is clearly human-centric, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly seeks information about individuals based on the use of \"who\" and the context of musical performances.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

    "label": "C02",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"who directed ` ` jaws ' ' ?\" This is an inquiry about the creator or performer of an action related to a specific entity. Specifically, it is asking for the identity of the person who directed the movie \"Jaws\". The information requested is the name or details of a human individual, as \"who\" typically refers to a person. The query includes the movie title in quotes, which provides context that the question is about a human role in a creative work.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or name, such as \"Steven Spielberg\", which represents a human individual. The answer could be a single name, a title (e.g., \"the director\"), or a brief description, but it will always refer to a person. Characteristics of the response include being human-centric, potentially involving a specific individual or group, and not requiring numerical data, definitions, or spatial details. The answer is straightforward and does not involve calculations, dates, or explanations beyond identifying a person.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"who\", which is a direct indicator of a human-related query, as it specifically seeks information about a person. The phrase \"directed\" is a verb that describes an action performed by a human, further emphasizing the human element. The quoted \"jaws\" refers to a well-known film, but the question is not about the film itself (which might fall under an entity category) but about the human involved in its creation. Other phrases like the double quotes might be formatting, but they do not change the core intent of asking about a person. These elements collectively point to the C02 category, which focuses on human-related information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"who directed ` ` jaws ' ' ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for information about a person. The word \"who\" is a pronoun that denotes a human subject, and \"directed\" is an action typically performed by individuals in a professional capacity, such as in film or media. The context of the movie \"Jaws\" is incidental; the core of the question is to identify a specific human (e.g., the director) rather than the movie as an object or concept. This aligns with the C02 category description: questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, it does not fit other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about \"what is Jaws?\" or \"describe Jaws,\" focusing on the film itself as an entity.\n- C03 (description) is for explanatory or definitional queries, which is not the case here.\n- C04 (numeric) involves numbers, which are not requested.\n- C05 (location) deals with places, irrelevant here.\n- C06 (abbreviation) concerns acronyms, not applicable. \nThus, the question is centered on human identity and action, making C02 the correct classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly asks for a human individual's identity, matching the C02 category definition precisely."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking for the specific Indian tribe that is in conflict with F troop. It seeks to identify a particular group, which is likely a historical, cultural, or military reference. The core request is for information about an Indian tribe, implying a need to name or describe the tribe.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or descriptive phrase naming an Indian tribe, such as \"Apache\" or \"Sioux\". This could be a simple name or a more detailed explanation, but the format suggests a direct identification. The answer is not numerical, descriptive in the sense of an explanation, or focused on a location; instead, it points to a human group.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases include \"Indian tribe\" and \"doing battle with\". \"Indian tribe\" refers to a group of people, which is inherently human-related. \"F troop\" likely denotes a military unit, adding a human element. The phrase \"perpetually doing battle with\" emphasizes ongoing conflict, which is a human activity. These elements suggest the question is centered on human groups and their interactions.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is inquiring about an Indian tribe, which is a group of people or human community. Although tribes can be seen as entities (C01), the focus here is on the human aspect—specifically, the people involved in the conflict. The category C02 encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, and this query directly seeks information about a human group in a battle scenario. The word \"tribe\" implies a collective of humans, and the context of \"doing battle with\" reinforces the human element, making C02 the appropriate classification. In contrast, C01 would be for questions about non-human entities, but a tribe is fundamentally human.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly centers on a human group and its activities, aligning with the C02 category."

It is not simply asking for a definition or identification but seeks an explanation of how and where this dish originated, which implies a need for detailed contextual information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as an explanation of the dish's history, cultural influences, or development over time. It may include elements like dates, places, or people, but the core format is narrative or explanatory, focusing on providing a comprehensive overview rather than a simple fact, number, or location name.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases like \"where did...come from?\" and \"origin\" suggest a search for historical or descriptive information. The term \"Indian pudding\" refers to a specific entity (a food), but the question is not about identifying it as an object or thing (C01) but about its background, which aligns with descriptive inquiries. Words like \"come from\" imply a need for an explanation rather than a direct location or numeric detail.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C03 - description).\nThe question \"where did Indian pudding come from?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the origin of the dish. This involves providing a narrative that may cover historical context, cultural evolution, and possibly how it spread or was influenced by various factors. For instance, a response might describe how Indian pudding, which is a type of dessert, originated in colonial America with influences from Native American or European traditions, making it a descriptive query. While the question could indirectly involve location (C05) or even human elements (C02), the primary intent is to seek a detailed account, not a specific place or person. This contrasts with C01 (entity), which would focus on identifying the pudding itself, C04 (numeric), which would require numbers, C05 (location), which would ask for a specific place, and C06 (abbreviation), which would deal with acronyms. Thus, the descriptive nature of the question aligns perfectly with C03.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's intent and the category definitions."

It directly references a person, Maurizio Pellegrin, but the core request is for the geographical location where that person resides. The question type is seeking a factual, specific answer related to a place, rather than an explanation or definition.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as \"Rome\" or \"London\", representing a city name. It is a concise, direct response without any need for elaboration, calculation, or contextual details. The answer format is typically a single word or a short phrase, indicating a specific entity or location. This suggests the question is not seeking descriptive or numerical data, but rather a pinpoint piece of information about a spatial reference.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"city\" and \"lives in\". \"City\" is a clear indicator of a geographical location, as it refers to a specific place within a broader context. \"Lives in\" implies a spatial relationship, further emphasizing the focus on location. The mention of \"maurizio pellegrin\" (a human name) provides context but does not shift the primary intent; the question is not about the person themselves but about the place associated with them. These elements align with the \"location\" category, which involves spatial or geographical inquiries.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a geographical place. While the question mentions a human (Maurizio Pellegrin), the central request is for the name of a city, which falls under the definition of \"location\" as per the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\"\n- To determine this, consider the alternatives:\n  - C01 (entity): This category could encompass cities as objects or concepts, but the question's focus is specifically on the spatial aspect (where someone lives), making \"location\" a more precise fit.\n  - C02 (human): This category is for questions about people or human-related information, but here, the question is not centered on Maurizio Pellegrin; it's using him as a reference to ask about a place. The primary information sought is not biographical or human-centric.\n  - C03 (description): This would involve explanations or definitions, but the question is straightforward and seeks a direct name, not a detailed account.\n  - C04 (numeric): No numbers, dates, or quantities are involved, so this doesn't apply.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): There are no abbreviations or acronyms in the question.\n- The key phrase \"city\" directly points to a location, and the structure of the question (\"what is the name of...\") is typical for seeking specific spatial information. This classification ensures that questions about places are grouped correctly, distinguishing them from broader entity or human-focused inquiries.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly targets a geographical location, and the reasoning based on key words, expected answer format, and category definitions consistently aligns with C05."

The answer may involve additional context if the name is not immediately known, but the core response is the name itself.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey phrases include \"what is the name\" and \"managing director.\" \"What is the name\" suggests a request for identification, often tied to a specific entity or person. \"Managing director\" is a human role, referring to an individual in a leadership position. The term \"apricot computer\" may refer to an entity (e.g., a company), but the question is centered on the human aspect of that entity. These keywords align with human-related inquiries, as they focus on people rather broadly on things or places.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is asking for information about a specific person—the managing director of Apricot Computer. While \"Apricot Computer\" could be considered an entity, the question is not seeking details about the company itself (which would fall under C01, entity), nor is it asking for a description, definition, number, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it directly targets human-related information by inquiring about an individual's name and role.

The category C02 is designed for questions about people, individuals, or human-related topics, making this classification appropriate.

Instead, it is requesting an explanation of the cause or rationale behind the association between horseshoes and luck, which involves cultural, historical, or superstitious context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive. It should provide a detailed explanation, potentially including origins, beliefs, or reasons why horseshoes are thought to bring good luck. This could involve historical anecdotes, folklore, or logical reasoning, but it should not be a simple fact, number, or abbreviation. The answer is likely to be narrative or explanatory in nature, focusing on the \"why\" aspect, rather than a concise definition or numerical value.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"why,\" which is a strong indicator of a question seeking an explanation or reason.

Instead, it requires a detailed explanation or step-by-step guidance on how to execute this action, which involves social etiquette, communication techniques, or psychological considerations. This indicates that the question is focused on describing a procedure or providing advice.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a series of steps, tips, or a narrative explanation. For example, the answer might cover topics like choosing the right time, opening lines, handling rejection, or cultural norms. It is not expected to be a simple yes/no, a numerical value, or a direct reference to an entity or location. The answer format is inherently explanatory, emphasizing detail and context, which aligns with categories that involve providing information rather than just facts.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how do you,\" which is a common phrase for questions seeking instructions or explanations. Additionally, phrases like \"ask a total stranger out on a date\" highlight a process-oriented inquiry. These words suggest that the question is not about identifying a specific thing (like an object or person) or a quantity, but rather about breaking down and describing an action. This contrasts with categories like C01 (entity) or C04 (numeric), which would involve direct references to objects or numbers.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information on how to perform a specific task. The core of the question is to understand the process of asking someone out, which requires a descriptive response that elaborates on methods, considerations, and potential outcomes. This is distinct from other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because it is not asking about a specific object or concept (e.g., \"what is a date?\").\n- It is not C02 (human) because while the topic involves human interactions, the question is not focused on people or individuals; instead, it is about the action itself.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are requested (e.g., \"how many dates should you ask for?\").\n- It is not C05 (location) because it does not involve places or spatial information.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because there is no mention of abbreviations or acronyms.\nThe descriptive nature of the question, with its focus on providing a step-by-step or explanatory answer, directly matches the definition of C03, which covers questions seeking detailed information or explanations.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question clearly requests a descriptive explanation of a process, aligning with the category's focus on providing detailed information."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what weapon is the mythological character apollo most proficient with?\" It is inquiring about a specific object or item associated with Apollo, a figure from mythology. The information requested is the name or identity of the weapon, which is a particular thing in the context of mythological lore. This suggests the question is seeking a specific entity, rather than a person, event, or abstract concept.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a noun or a short phrase naming the weapon, such as \"bow\" or \"arrow,\" based on common knowledge of Apollo's attributes in mythology. The answer format is factual and specific, focusing on an object or concept, without requiring numerical data, descriptive text, or other categories like dates or locations. This indicates a straightforward identification of an entity.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"weapon,\" which refers to a tangible object, and \"mythological character,\" which points to a specific concept or thing in a cultural or historical context. The phrase \"most proficient with\" implies a query for a particular item associated with Apollo. These elements align with the C01 category, as they involve asking about a specific object or thing, rather than a human, description, number, location, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question is centered on identifying a specific weapon from mythology, which is an object (e.g., Apollo's bow or arrows). This falls under the C01 category (\"entity\") because it asks about a particular thing or concept, not a person, event, or abstract idea. While Apollo is a human-like figure, the question is not about him but about the weapon he is proficient with, making it an entity-focused query. There is no indication of a numeric value, location, or abbreviation, and the answer does not require a descriptive or explanatory format. Thus, the question fits C01 as it seeks a specific object in a mythological context.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's focus on a specific object (weapon) within a mythological framework."

The question does not focus on defining a concept, describing something in detail, providing a number, or explaining an abbreviation; instead, it is directly asking for the name of the country that claims jurisdiction or ownership over these islands.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question is likely a proper noun, such as \"Ecuador,\" which is the name of a country. The response is typically a short, specific piece of information, often a single word or a brief phrase, rather than a numerical value, a descriptive paragraph, or a list. This suggests that the answer is categorical and factual, aligning with a classification that involves spatial or geographical data.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"country,\" \"galapagos islands,\" and \"belong to.\" \"Country\" refers to a nation-state, which is a type of location. \"Galapagos Islands\" is a specific set of islands, which are geographical features. \"Belong to\" implies a relationship of ownership or affiliation, often tied to political or spatial boundaries. These elements collectively point to a question about geographical locations, as they involve identifying where something is situated in the world.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what country do the galapagos islands belong to ?\" falls under category C05 (location) because it is explicitly asking about a geographical location and its affiliation with a country. The Galapagos Islands are a well-known archipelago, and the query seeks to determine which country they are part of, which is a spatial or geographical inquiry. Category C05 encompasses questions that deal with places, such as cities, countries, islands, or other physical locations, and their attributes. In contrast:\n- C01 (entity) might apply to broader concepts, but this question is specifically tied to a location rather than a general thing.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as no people are mentioned or implied.\n- C03 (description) is not applicable, as the question does not request an explanation or definition.\n- C04 (numeric) does not fit, since no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is unrelated, as there is no mention of an acronym or shortened form.\nThus, the focus on identifying a country and the geographical nature of the query clearly aligns with C05.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's content and the provided category definitions."

The phrase \"the prophet of the muslim people\" specifies that the information being sought is about a specific human figure in a religious context. In this case, the question is asking for the identity of a person, likely referring to Prophet Muhammad in Islam, as he is widely recognized as the prophet for Muslims. The core request is for a name or description of a human being, rather than an abstract concept, object, or other type of information.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a proper noun or a descriptive phrase naming a specific individual. For instance, a common response might be \"Prophet Muhammad\" or a brief explanation of his role. This format aligns with human-related questions, as it involves identifying or describing a person. The answer is not expected to be a number, date, measurement, or abbreviation, nor is it seeking a detailed explanation or definition unless specified. The characteristics of the expected answer include being personal, specific, and focused on human attributes or roles, such as ancestry, achievements, or historical significance.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"who,\" which is a strong indicator of a human-focused query, as it directly asks for information about a person. Additionally, \"prophet\" refers to a human figure in religious traditions, and \"muslim people\" refers to a human group, emphasizing the human element. Other phrases like \"was\" suggest a historical or biographical inquiry, further reinforcing the focus on a person. These elements contrast with categories like C03 (description), which might involve definitions or explanations, or C04 (numeric), which would require numbers or dates. The absence of words like \"where,\" \"when,\" \"how many,\" or \"what does\" helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"who was the prophet of the muslim people?\" should be classified under category C02, \"human,\" because it is fundamentally asking about a specific individual or person. The word \"who\" is a primary cue for human-related questions, as it seeks personal identification rather than abstract information. In this context, the question is inquiring about Prophet Muhammad, a historical and religious figure, whose identity is tied to human experiences, roles, and narratives. This aligns with the category description for C02, which includes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. \n\nMoreover, the question does not fit other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because entities refer to objects or concepts, and while \"prophet\" could be seen as a concept, the question is specifically asking about the human who held that role.\n- It is not C03 (description) because it is not seeking an explanation or definition; it is asking for the identity of a person.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) as no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.\n- It is not C05 (location) since the focus is on a person, not a place.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) as there is no abbreviation being queried.\n\nThe expected answer format, which is typically a name or short biographical detail, further supports the human category. For example, a response might be \"Prophet Muhammad,\" which is a human-centric answer. This classification ensures that the question is directed toward human knowledge, such as figures in history, religion, or culture.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly seeks information about a specific human being, aligning perfectly with the definition of category C02."

It begins with \"who\", which is a pronoun typically used to inquire about a person or individual. The subject is \"snoopy ' s arch enemy\", referring to a specific entity associated with Snoopy, likely from the Peanuts comic strip. The information being requested is the identity of Snoopy's arch enemy, which implies a need to name or describe a person or human-like character.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a name or a descriptive identifier of a person. For example, in the context of Peanuts, Snoopy's arch enemy is commonly Linus, a human character. The answer should be concise and likely a proper noun or a reference to a human individual, rather than a numerical value, location, or abstract concept. This suggests the answer is not seeking a definition or explanation but rather a specific reference to a person.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"who\", which explicitly indicates a query about a person or human entity. The phrase \"snoopy ' s arch enemy\" uses \"arch enemy\", a term often associated with human antagonists in stories or media. Snoopy himself is a fictional character, but the question focuses on his enemy, which is typically a human character. There are no words or phrases suggesting a non-human entity, numeric value, location, or abbreviation, which helps narrow the category to human-related information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it directly asks for the identity of a person who is Snoopy's arch enemy. The word \"who\" is a strong indicator of human-related information, as it seeks to identify an individual rather than an object, concept, or location. In this case, Snoopy's arch enemy is a human character (e.g., Linus in the Peanuts comic), making the question centered on people or individuals. While Snoopy is an entity (C01), the question is not about Snoopy himself but about his enemy, which is specifically human-oriented. There is no indication of a description (C03), numeric (C04), location (C05), or abbreviation (C06) being sought, as the focus is purely on identifying a person.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and key words unambiguously point to a human-related inquiry."

The phrase \"nature of\" indicates a request for a comprehensive understanding, such as its components, processes, or implications.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question would likely be descriptive, involving a detailed explanation, definition, or elaboration on the concept of learning. For example, a response might cover psychological, educational, or philosophical aspects, such as theories of learning, its stages, or examples. The answer format is not numerical, categorical, or concise (like a list or a single fact); it requires a narrative or explanatory style. This aligns with questions that demand depth and elaboration rather than brevity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"what is the nature of.\" This phrase is commonly associated with descriptive inquiries, as it prompts an explanation or definition. Additionally, \"learning\" is a broad concept, but the focus is on its \"nature,\" which implies seeking characteristics or a detailed breakdown. Other phrases like \"what does\" or \"explain\" often signal the description category (C03). In contrast, words like \"who,\" \"where,\" \"how many,\" or \"what does it stand for\" would point to other categories, but they are absent here.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the nature of learning?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a concept. Category C03 is designed for questions that seek elaborative responses, such as defining terms, explaining processes, or providing in-depth descriptions. In this case:  \n- \"Nature\" implies an inquiry into the essence or characteristics of learning, which requires a descriptive answer rather than a factual one.  \n- Learning is a conceptual topic, not tied to a specific entity (C01), human (C02), number (C04), location (C05), or abbreviation (C06).  \n- The question does not request a specific object, person, quantity, place, or acronym; it asks for a broader understanding, making it a prime candidate for the description category.  \nThis classification is consistent with the category description, as it involves seeking detailed information that explains or defines the concept.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a descriptive explanation, which matches category C03.

Specifically, it is asking for the term used to describe a young fox, which is a biological or zoological concept. The question type is inquiring about a categorical label or name for something, rather than seeking an explanation, number, or location. The information being requested is a noun or short phrase that represents the entity in question.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a single word or a short noun phrase, such as \"fox cub\" or \"kit,\" which directly names the entity. It is not expecting a detailed explanation, multiple numbers, dates, or spatial descriptions. The answer should be concise and referential, pointing to a specific thing or concept. This format aligns with questions that seek definitions or labels, but in this case, it is focused on the term itself rather than elaboration.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases include \"what 's the term for,\" which is a common phrase used to ask for the name or definition of something. Additionally, \"young fox\" specifies a particular entity—a biological concept related to animals. These keywords suggest that the question is about identifying or retrieving a specific term for an object or thing, rather than asking about people, numbers, locations, or abbreviations. The phrase \"term for\" often indicates a request for a categorical or definitional label, which falls under the broader category of entities.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what 's the term for a young fox ?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific term that refers to a particular concept or thing. In this case, \"young fox\" is the entity being described, and the question is seeking its formal or common name. This fits the category description for C01, which includes questions about specific objects, concepts, or things. For example, asking for the term for a \"fox cub\" is akin to asking for the name of a specific animal stage, which is an entity. Other categories do not apply:\n  - C02 (human) is incorrect because no human or human-related information is involved.\n  - C03 (description) is not a good fit because the question is not asking for an explanation or detailed information; it is seeking a direct term.\n  - C04 (numeric) is irrelevant as there are no numbers, dates, or quantities requested.\n  - C05 (location) does not apply since the question is not about a place or spatial information.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is not relevant because the question is not asking for the meaning of an acronym or shortened form.\n- The core of the question is to identify or retrieve a named entity, making C01 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C01\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly asks for a specific term related to a concept or thing, which aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, and the analysis of keywords and expected answer format supports this categorization."

The core inquiry is to identify which U.S. state fits this description, focusing on its geographical and historical attributes.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a specific U.S. state, such as \"Georgia\" or \"Louisiana,\" which are known to have been under multiple flags historically. The answer format is a proper noun representing a place, and it may involve some contextual historical knowledge, but the primary output is a location-based entity.

The answer format is not numerical (e.g., a number or date), not a simple list, and not focused on spatial or locational details. Instead, it requires a detailed, explanatory format that elaborates on the subject, making it suitable for a descriptive category.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to request definitions, explanations, or descriptions. The subject \"titanium\" is a specific entity, but the question is not asking for its classification as an entity (e.g., \"what is titanium in chemistry?\"), but rather for its overall description. Phrases like \"what is\" often signal a need for definitional or explanatory information, aligning with categories that focus on detailed information rather than identification or facts.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or definition of titanium, which falls under the description category as per the provided definitions. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek detailed information, explanations, or definitions, such as \"what is\" or \"describe\" queries. In this case, the question is not inquiring about a specific entity in a categorical sense (C01), nor is it asking for a number, date, or measurement (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires a descriptive response that covers aspects like titanium's atomic number, its role in industry, or its physical properties. For example, a typical answer might include: \"Titanium is a chemical element with the symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a strong, lightweight, and corrosion-resistant metal, commonly used in aerospace and medical implants.\" This type of response is explanatory and detailed, fitting the description category. The use of \"what is\" is a strong indicator of this category, as it often precedes questions that demand more than just identification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question explicitly requests a descriptive explanation rather than a specific entity, numeric value, location, or abbreviation."

The phrase \"what is\" is a common indicator of a question that requires descriptive information, such as a definition or explanation of a concept.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would be a descriptive response, likely including a definition, characteristics, examples, and perhaps contextual information about caldera in a geological or geographical context. It is not expected to be a simple yes/no, a numerical value, or a specific location. The answer format is explanatory and may involve providing details to clarify the concept, making it suitable for a descriptive category.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"what is,\" which is a standard phrase used to request definitions or explanations. The term \"caldera\" refers to a specific concept (a geological formation), but the question is not focused on identifying its type (e.g., entity) or asking for its properties in a numerical way. Instead, the phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a need for a descriptive explanation, aligning with the C03 category. Other categories, like C01 (entity), might apply to the subject matter, but the question type overrides that by emphasizing explanation over identification.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is a caldera?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the concept. A caldera is a specific geological entity, but the question is not seeking to identify it as an object (C01) or provide numerical data (C04). Instead, it requires a descriptive response that defines what a caldera is, its formation, and other relevant details. This matches the C03 category, which encompasses questions that request explanations, definitions, or elaborations on concepts. For instance, if the question was \"What is the capital of France?\", it might lean toward C05 (location), but here, the \"what is\" structure is more indicative of a descriptive query. The correct classification is C03, as confirmed by the label provided.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure (\"what is\") and intent (seeking a definition or explanation) align perfectly with the C03 category, and caldera is a concept that benefits from descriptive detail rather than other categories like C01 or C04."

This is a straightforward inquiry about a specific geographical feature. The question is requesting information on the endpoint of the Danube River, which is a body of water. The key elements here are \"body of water\" and \"flow into,\" indicating a focus on spatial or geographical details. Essentially, the question is asking for the name of a specific location where the river terminates.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or a named geographical feature, such as \"the Black Sea\" or \"the Mediterranean Sea.\" It does not require a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, or information about individuals. The answer format is typically a single entity or a short phrase referring to a place, which aligns with categorical responses in location-based queries. This suggests that the answer is not a number, date, or abbreviation, but rather a specific reference to a physical location.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe question contains several key phrases: \"body of water\" and \"flow into.\" \"Body of water\" refers to a geographical feature like a sea, ocean, lake, or river delta, which is inherently tied to spatial or locational information. \"Flow into\" implies a directional relationship, pointing to a destination or endpoint, which is characteristic of questions about locations. Additionally, the mention of the Danube River (a specific entity) is contextual, but the core query is about its geographical endpoint, reinforcing the location theme. No words like \"definition,\" \"number,\" \"person,\" or \"abbreviation\" are present, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is fundamentally asking about a geographical place or spatial information. The category C05 encompasses questions that seek details about physical locations, such as seas, rivers, mountains, or other geographical features. In this case, the query is specifically about identifying the body of water into which the Danube River flows, which is a clear example of a location-based question. It is not asking for a general concept (C01, entity), as it is focused on a specific instance rather than a broad idea. It does not involve people (C02, human), as no individuals are mentioned. There is no request for a definition or explanation (C03, description), nor is it seeking a numerical value like a distance or quantity (C04, numeric). Finally, it is not inquiring about an abbreviation (C06, abbreviation), as no acronym or shortened form is referenced. The primary intent is to locate or identify a specific place, making C05 the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly addresses a geographical endpoint, which is explicitly covered by the C05 category, and the analysis of key words and expected answer format supports this."

It is not asking for a specific object, person, numerical value, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it seeks a narrative or detailed account of how skateboarding began, key milestones, influential figures, and its cultural impact over time. The core request is for an explanation of the subject's historical context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be descriptive, involving a sequence of events, timelines, and contextual details. It could take the form of a paragraph, essay, or bullet-point list, but the essence is that it requires a comprehensive explanation rather than a simple fact, number, or definition. For instance, an answer might cover the invention of the first skateboards, the evolution of styles (e.g., kicktail designs), major eras (e.g., the Golden Age of Skateboarding), and societal influences. This format is inherently explanatory and detailed, focusing on providing a full picture rather than a concise response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"what is\" and \"history.\" \"What is\" often signals a request for an explanation, definition, or description, as it prompts for clarification or detailed information. \"History\" specifically refers to the study or recounting of past events, which inherently involves descriptive elements. These words align with categories that emphasize narrative or informational depth, such as C03 (description), rather than categories focused on specific entities, humans, numbers, locations, or abbreviations. No words in the question suggest a numerical query, geographical focus, or acronym meaning.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the history of skateboarding?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanatory or detailed account of a topic. The category C03 encompasses questions that seek explanations, definitions, or in-depth information, which matches the nature of this query. Here, the user is not inquiring about a specific entity (like a skateboard itself, which would be C01), a human-related aspect (such as famous skaters, which could be C02), a numerical fact (like the number of skateboarding-related injuries, which is C04), a location (e.g., where skateboarding originated, which might be C05), or an abbreviation (e.g., what \"Vert\" means in skateboarding, which is C06). Instead, the question demands a descriptive response that covers the timeline, causes, and developments of skateboarding's history. For example, an answer would describe events like the invention in the 1950s, the resurgence in the 1970s, and modern innovations, which is characteristic of the description category. This classification ensures that the response provides the rich, narrative information expected, rather than a fragmented or categorical answer.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's focus on \"history\" clearly indicates a need for descriptive and explanatory information, which is precisely defined by the C03 category. Any deviation would misclassify the query, as other categories do not adequately cover the request for a detailed historical narrative."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"when did cnn begin broadcasting?\" is inquiring about the specific time or date when the Cable News Network (CNN) started its broadcasting operations. This type of question seeks factual information related to a historical event, specifically the inception date of CNN, which is a quantitative piece of information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., 1980), a month and year (e.g., June 1980), or a full date (e.g., June 1, 1980). It could also be a simple number if the context specifies a year, but in general, the answer involves a measurement of time, which is inherently numerical. The response does not require descriptive text, but rather a precise, quantifiable answer that can be verified or looked up in a database.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"when,\" which is a temporal indicator often associated with dates or times, and \"begin broadcasting,\" which refers to the start of an event. These words point to the need for a numerical answer, as they request a specific point in time. Additionally, \"cnn\" is an entity, but the question is not focused on describing or identifying it; instead, it's asking for a temporal fact about it.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"when did cnn begin broadcasting?\" falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is asking for a specific date or numerical value related to the start of CNN's operations. This involves a measurement of time, such as a year, month, or day, which is a core aspect of the numeric category. The category C04 is designed for questions that seek numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements, and this question directly fits that description by requesting a temporal fact. In contrast, it does not align with other categories: C01 (entity) would involve questions about what CNN is or its characteristics, but here the focus is on a specific event; C02 (human) would concern people or individuals, which is not the case; C03 (description) would ask for explanations or definitions, but this question seeks a factual date; C05 (location) would involve geographical places, which is irrelevant; and C06 (abbreviation) would ask for the meaning of \"CNN,\" which is not the intent here. Therefore, the question is best classified as numeric due to its direct request for a quantifiable temporal answer.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly asks for a date or numerical value, which aligns perfectly with the definition of the numeric category."

It is not requesting a single fact, a list of items, or a direct measurement; instead, it asks for a detailed account of the underlying mechanism or process. The core request is for descriptive information about how and why shivering occurs in response to cold.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a textual explanation, possibly including scientific or biological details, such as the role of the nervous system, metabolic processes, or evolutionary adaptations. It could involve step-by-step descriptions, definitions of related terms, or examples to illustrate the cause. The answer is not expected to be a simple number, a date, a list of entities, or a concise definition without elaboration. Instead, it requires a narrative or explanatory style that provides depth and context.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"what causes,\" which is a direct indicator of a question seeking an explanation or description. Other phrases like \"body to shiver\" and \"in cold temperatures\" provide context but do not alter the fundamental request for descriptive information. These words point to a category involving explanations, definitions, or detailed breakdowns of concepts, which aligns with the description provided for C03.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what causes the body to shiver in cold temperatures?\" is asking for an explanation of a biological process, which falls under the category of \"description.\" This is evident because:\n- It uses the phrase \"what causes,\" which typically prompts an explanatory response rather than a factual one.\n- The topic involves a physiological mechanism (shivering as a response to cold), which requires a descriptive answer that explains how the body works, including details like the involvement of brown fat, muscle contractions, and heat generation.\n- None of the other categories fit:\n  - C01 (entity) is for questions about specific objects or concepts, but this question is not asking for a definition of shivering itself or a list of related entities; it's seeking the cause.\n  - C02 (human) focuses on people or human-related information, but the question is about a general physiological response, not about individuals or human experiences.\n  - C04 (numeric) involves numbers or quantities, but the question does not ask for a count, measurement, or date (e.g., \"how many calories are burned\" or \"what temperature triggers shivering\").\n  - C05 (location) is for geographical or spatial information, which is irrelevant here as the question is not about places.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms or shortened forms, which is not applicable since the question does not involve any abbreviations.\n- Therefore, the question is best classified under C03 because it explicitly requests a detailed, explanatory description of a phenomenon.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure and wording consistently align with the definition of C03, which is for questions seeking explanations, definitions, or detailed information, and there are no elements that suggest any other category."

The request is for descriptive information about the nature, behavior, and implications of these market states.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive and explanatory. It should provide a detailed explanation, including definitions, examples, and possibly historical or contextual information about bear and bull markets. Characteristics of the response include being textual, educational, and aimed at clarifying the concepts, rather than being numerical, location-based, or focused on abbreviations. For instance, the answer might explain that a bull market is a period of rising stock prices with optimistic investor sentiment, while a bear market involves declining prices and pessimism.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what are,\" which is a common indicator of a descriptive or definitional query. Additionally, \"bear and bull markets\" are specific terms that require explanation. These words point to a need for detailed information rather than identification of a thing, person, number, place, or abbreviation. The phrase \"what are\" is often used in questions seeking definitions or explanations, aligning with categories like C03.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what are bear and bull markets ?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about financial market concepts. C03 is designed for questions that seek elaborative responses, such as definitions, characteristics, or contextual details. In this case, the question does not request a specific entity (like a company or object, which would be C01), a human-related aspect (like a person's role, C02), a numerical value (like a date or quantity, C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation's meaning (C06). Instead, it focuses on providing a clear, descriptive account of what bear and bull markets are, which is inherently explanatory. For example, a bear market might be described as a prolonged period of declining stock prices, often accompanied by economic recession, while a bull market is characterized by rising prices and economic growth. This type of query fits the C03 category as it requires a narrative or definitional response rather than a factual or quantitative one.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly uses \"what are\" to request definitions and explanations, which directly matches the C03 category's focus on descriptive and informational queries."

This is asking for the specific book authored by J.R.R. Tolkien in which Bilbo Baggins is the central character. The core request is to identify a particular book, which is an object or thing in the context of literature.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer is likely the title of the book, such as \"The Hobbit\". This is a specific name or identifier for a thing, not a person, event, number, or descriptive explanation. The answer format is typically a proper noun or a phrase, indicating a concrete entity rather than abstract information like a definition or quantity.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words include \"book\", \"features\", and \"central character\". \"Book\" directly refers to an object or thing, while \"Bilbo Baggins\" is a character, but the question is centered on the book itself. The phrase \"features as the central character\" specifies that the answer is a specific book containing this element. There are no words indicating a person (e.g., \"who\"), a number (e.g., \"how many\"), a location (e.g., \"where\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does X mean\"). This points to the \"entity\" category, as the question is seeking a specific thing.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object or concept—the book. J.R.R. Tolkien's books are literary works, which are tangible entities in the sense of titles and content. The question is not focused on Bilbo Baggins himself (which would be a \"human\" category if it were about his life or characteristics), nor is it asking for a description of the book, a numeric value like publication date or page count, a location, or an abbreviation. Instead, it requires identifying the exact book, which is an entity.

The entity in question is a \"female rabbit,\" which refers to a specific type of animal. The information being requested is the common or scientific name used to describe this entity, such as \"doe\" in biological contexts. This indicates that the question is focused on identifying or naming a thing, rather than asking for subjective opinions, calculations, or other types of information.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a noun or a short phrase, as it is asking for a name or term. For example, a response might be \"a female rabbit is called a doe\" or \"it is referred to as a vixen in some contexts.\" The answer is not expected to be a number, a date, a detailed explanation, or a location. It is concise and factual, focusing on the identification of the entity. This suggests that the answer is straightforward and categorical, aligning with a question that seeks definitional or naming information.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is,\" \"called,\" and \"female rabbit.\" \n- \"what is\" is a common interrogative phrase that often signals a question seeking identification, definition, or classification.\n- \"called\" specifically directs the query toward asking for a name, term, or label.\n- \"female rabbit\" specifies the entity being referred to, which is a concrete biological concept. These elements collectively point to a question about a specific thing or object, rather than a person, place, description, number, or abbreviation.\n\n#### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is a female rabbit called?\" should be classified under category C01 (entity) because it directly asks for the name or term associated with a specific entity. An entity, in this context, refers to a distinct object, concept, or being, such as an animal or biological classification. Here, the entity is \"female rabbit,\" which is a particular type of animal, and the question is seeking its common or formal designation (e.g., \"doe\"). This fits the C01 category, as it involves querying for information about a thing, rather than a human (C02), a detailed explanation (C03), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The question is not about a person, so C02 is incorrect; it does not require a definition or description, so C03 is not applicable; it does not involve numbers or dates, so C04 is ruled out; it is not about a place, so C05 is not relevant; and it is not asking for an acronym's meaning, so C06 is not appropriate. Therefore, C01 is the most accurate category, as it encompasses questions about specific entities and their names or classifications.\n\n#### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01. I am highly confident in this classification because the question clearly seeks the name of a specific biological entity, which aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, and there are no elements suggesting other categories."

The core request is for spatial or positional information, specifically a virtual or online location, rather than a definition, description, or numerical data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format should provide a specific location or set of locations on the internet, such as a website URL, a search term, or a description of an online platform. For example, the answer might include names of websites like Genius, Musixmatch, or other lyric databases, or it could guide the user to search engines or forums. The answer is expected to be a string or phrase that indicates a place, and it may involve multiple options or categories, but it should not be a number, date, or abstract concept. The characteristics of the answer are location-based, meaning it focuses on where something can be found online, rather than what it is or how many there are.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"where on the internet\" and \"location,\" which directly signal a request for spatial or geographical information. The word \"internet\" specifies that the location is online, and \"song lyrics database\" identifies the subject matter. The mention of \"similar to the international lyrics server\" provides context but does not alter the fundamental request for a place. These keywords align with the C05 category, which involves questions about places or locations, including virtual ones. There are no indicators of numeric, description, entity, human, or abbreviation categories in the question.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is explicitly asking for a specific place or location on the internet where a resource can be found. The phrase \"where on the internet\" is a clear indicator of a location-based inquiry, as it seeks spatial information in a digital context. While the question involves finding a \"song lyrics database,\" which could be seen as an entity (C01), the primary focus is on the location aspect, not the nature of the database itself. The category C05 encompasses questions about places, including online locations, as defined in the descriptions. This question does not require a definition (C03), a number (C04), information about a person (C02), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is fundamentally about directing the user to a specific online spot, making C05 the most appropriate classification. The similarity to the International Lyrics Server adds detail but does not shift the category, as it still centers on the search for a location.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification, as the question directly asks for a location on the internet, aligning perfectly with the C05 category description."

The request is for identifying particular examples of products that share a common symbol (a tiger), indicating a need for specific instances rather than general information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format involves listing or naming two specific products, such as brand names or product categories, that incorporate a tiger symbol. This suggests a response that is descriptive and example-based, rather than numerical, definitional, or abstract. The answer should be concise and directly reference the entities in question, without requiring calculations, dates, or explanations beyond identification.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"products,\" \"use,\" and \"symbol.\" \"Products\" refers to tangible or intangible items, concepts, or entities in a business or consumer context. \"Use\" implies possession or application of a symbol, and \"tiger\" is a specific symbol or motif. These words point to a query about particular objects or things, aligning with the C01 category, which focuses on entities. There are no indicators of human involvement, locations, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for specific objects or concepts—namely, products—that have a particular attribute (using a tiger as a symbol). \"Products\" are entities in the sense that they are distinct, identifiable items or brands, such as consumer goods, services, or corporate entities. The question seeks examples of these entities, which is characteristic of an entity-focused query. It does not involve people (C02), explanations or definitions (C03), quantities or measurements (C04), places (C05), or acronym meanings (C06).

It is not seeking a specific fact, a numerical value, or a simple definition, but rather an explanation of the steps involved in the announcement. The core request is for detailed information on how this event is made known to the public.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is descriptive and explanatory. It should provide a step-by-step or detailed account of the announcement process, such as the use of traditional signals (e.g., the smoking of the papal ballots), official communications, and media dissemination. The response is likely to be narrative or procedural, focusing on clarity and completeness, rather than being concise, numerical, or focused on a single piece of information.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how,\" \"announced,\" and \"election of a new pope.\" The word \"how\" is a strong indicator of a descriptive question, as it prompts an explanation or definition of a process. \"Announced\" refers to the act of making something known, which involves detailing the method. The phrase \"election of a new pope\" provides context but does not shift the question toward a different category like entity or location; instead, it anchors the description to a specific event.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C03 (description) because it asks for an explanation or detailed information about a process. Specifically, it seeks to understand the method by which the election is announced, which involves describing steps, traditions, and mechanisms. For instance, the answer might cover the conclave's procedures, the role of the Swiss Guard, or the use of Vatican Radio and global media. This contrasts with other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because it is not asking about a specific object or concept (e.g., \"What is the papal election?\").\n- It is not C02 (human) because while the pope and participants are involved, the focus is on the announcement process, not individuals or human relations.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are requested (e.g., \"When does the announcement happen?\").\n- It is not C05 (location) because the question is about the method of announcement, not the place or geography involved.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because no abbreviations or acronyms are mentioned or implied.

It is not seeking a definition, a specific fact, a number, or a location. Instead, it is requesting an explanation of the biological mechanism involved, such as egg-laying, fertilization, incubation, and hatching. The core request is for a descriptive account of how this process works.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a detailed, explanatory response, such as a step-by-step description of the reproductive cycle in chickens. This could include information on mating behaviors, egg formation, fertilization, embryo development, egg incubation (either by the mother or externally), and the hatching process.\n- Characteristics of the answer: It should be narrative or explanatory in nature, providing context and details rather than a simple fact, number, or definition. For instance, a typical response might explain concepts like ovulation, fertilization in the oviduct, egg formation, and the role of the hen in incubation. This contrasts with categories like numeric (which would require a specific number) or location (which would require a place-based description).\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"how\" – This interrogative word is a strong indicator of a descriptive or explanatory question, as it prompts for a process or method rather than a simple identification or fact.\n- \"have baby chicks\" – This phrase refers to a biological process and implies a need for detailed information on reproduction. It does not point to a specific entity, human, number, location, or abbreviation.\n- Category indicators: The use of \"how\" aligns with the C03 category, which is defined for questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information. Other categories, like C01 (entity) for specific things or C02 (human) for people, do not fit here, as the question is about an animal process, not a person or a standalone object.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"how do chickens have baby chicks?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation of a process. The word \"how\" is a key signal that the response should be descriptive, providing a step-by-step breakdown of the reproductive cycle in chickens. This includes details such as courtship, egg production, fertilization, incubation periods, and chick hatching, all of which require explanatory language.\n- Unlike C01 (entity), which would involve questions like \"what is a chicken?\" or \"what are baby chicks?\", this question is not seeking a definition or identification of a thing. It is focused on the \"how,\" making it procedural and explanatory.\n- It also differs from C02 (human), as chickens are not human-related; the question is about animal biology.\n- C04 (numeric) is not applicable, as no numbers (e.g., dates, quantities like \"how many days\") are requested or implied.\n- C05 (location) is irrelevant, as the question does not ask about where this process occurs (e.g., \"where do chickens lay eggs?\").\n- C06 (abbreviation) is not relevant, as there is no mention of an acronym or initialism.\n- Therefore, the question's focus on explaining a biological process clearly matches the C03 category, which is designed for questions that demand detailed, descriptive information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C03\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (99%) that this classification is correct because the question's structure and key words (\"how\") unambiguously indicate a need for descriptive information, and it aligns perfectly with the category's definition."

The core request is for a cost, which implies a quantitative measurement, such as a price in dollars, euros, or another currency unit. The question is not focused on identifying the tent itself or its features but rather on obtaining a monetary figure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer for this question should be a numerical value, such as a dollar amount (e.g., \"$25\" or \"$50\"), a range (e.g., \"between $10 and $30\"), or a calculated figure based on given dimensions. The answer may involve simple arithmetic if the tent's size or other factors are used in a pricing formula, but the fundamental output is a number. This contrasts with descriptive or categorical answers, as the user is not asking for an explanation or definition but rather a specific measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"how much\" – This phrase is a strong indicator of a numeric question, as it directly solicits quantitative information, often related to cost, quantity, or measurement.\n- \"cost\" – This word explicitly refers to financial expense, which is inherently numerical and aligns with the C04 category.\n- \"purchase\" – This implies an action with a monetary implication, reinforcing the need for a numerical answer.\n- The description \"2 foot square party tent, with sides\" provides context but does not shift the question's focus; it merely specifies the item whose cost is being inquired about.\n\nThese elements collectively point to a request for a numerical response, as opposed to descriptive, locational, or other types of information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C04 - numeric).**\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a cost, which is a type of measurement that requires a numerical answer. Cost involves quantifying an expense, often in units like currency (e.g., dollars), and this directly matches the definition of the C04 category, which includes questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. \n\n- The word \"how much\" is a common trigger for numeric questions, as it prompts the user to expect a numerical response rather than a qualitative one.\n- The term \"cost\" further solidifies this, as it is a financial metric that is typically expressed in numbers.\n- While the question mentions a specific item (\"2 foot square party tent\"), the focus is not on its description or characteristics (which would align with C03), nor is it about its location or size in a spatial sense (which would align with C05). Instead, the primary information sought is the monetary value, making it numeric.\n- This classification is appropriate because the answer would likely be a number or a calculation involving numbers, whereas other categories do not fit:\n  - C01 (entity) would apply if the question was asking about what the tent is or its properties.\n  - C02 (human) is irrelevant, as no people are mentioned.\n  - C03 (description) would be for explanations or definitions, not numerical values.\n  - C05 (location) is not relevant, as there is no geographical element.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as no abbreviations are involved.\n\nThus, the question is best classified as numeric due to its direct request for a cost, which inherently involves numerical data.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High, as the question unambiguously asks for a cost, which is a standard numeric query, and the reasoning aligns closely with the category definition."

The question focuses on a human being and a factual attribute related to her career.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing the name of an actress, such as \"Meryl Streep\" or \"Cate Blanchett,\" along with potentially a brief context or ranking (e.g., \"the actress with the most Oscar nominations is...\"). The answer is not expected to be a number, date, definition, or location. Instead, it is a declarative statement about a person, which aligns with human-related information. This suggests the question is not seeking a purely numerical or descriptive response but rather an identification of an individual.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"actress\" and \"oscar nominations.\" \"Actress\" directly refers to a human individual, specifically a female performer, which is a human-related term. \"Oscar nominations\" is a factual detail about that person, but it does not change the primary focus on the human subject. Other phrases like \"has received the most\" imply a comparison or record, but the question is not asking for an explanation of what nominations are or the exact number; it is asking for the actress herself. This reinforces the human category, as the question centers on a person rather than an abstract concept or thing.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C02 (human) because it is primarily asking about a specific individual—a human being—in the context of their achievements. The category C02 is defined as \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" In this case, the question is inquiring about an actress, who is a person, and the information sought is about her status (having the most Oscar nominations). This fits the human category because:\n- It involves identifying a real-world person, not an object, concept, or location.\n- While the phrase \"oscar nominations\" has a numeric aspect (involving counts), the question is not directly requesting a number or date; it is asking for the entity (the actress) associated with that numeric fact.\n- It does not align with C01 (entity), as \"entity\" is broader and could include non-human things, but here the focus is specifically on a human individual.\n- It does not fit C03 (description), as the question is not seeking an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what is an Oscar nomination?\").\n- It does not match C04 (numeric), because although nominations are quantitative, the question is not asking for a specific number or date; it is asking for the person with that attribute.\n- It is unrelated to C05 (location) or C06 (abbreviation), as there is no mention of places or acronyms.\n\nThus, the question is best classified under C02 because it is fundamentally about a human individual and their career-related information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly involves identifying a human being based on a factual record, which aligns perfectly with the C02 category."

Here, \"equity securities\" refers to a financial concept, and the request is for an explanation or definition of this term. The information being sought is not a specific fact like a date or quantity, but rather a detailed account of what equity securities entail, such as their definition, examples, and context within finance.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is explanatory and descriptive. It should provide a clear definition, possibly including examples, historical context, or how equity securities function in the market. The answer is likely to be a paragraph or more of detailed information, rather than a simple yes/no, a number, a location, or a list. Characteristics include the need for elaboration, clarity, and educational value, as the question is probing for understanding rather than a quick fact.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words in the question include \"what are,\" which is a direct indicator of a descriptive or definitional query. \"Equity securities\" is a noun phrase representing a financial concept, but the phrase \"what are\" shifts the focus from identification to explanation. There are no words suggesting a numeric request (e.g., \"how many\"), location (e.g., \"where\"), or abbreviation (e.g., \"what does\"). The language is straightforward and seeks clarification, aligning with the C03 category's emphasis on detailed information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what are equity securities ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition of a concept. C03 is designed for questions that require detailed, informative responses, such as defining terms, explaining processes, or providing in-depth descriptions. In this case, the user is not asking for a specific entity (C01), a human-related aspect (C02), a numeric value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation's meaning (C06). Instead, the query seeks a comprehensive understanding of equity securities, which involves describing what they are, their types, and their role in financial markets. This fits perfectly with the C03 category, as it demands a descriptive answer rather than a factual one.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence statement: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and wording clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, which aligns with the C03 category's focus on explanations and definitions."

It is requesting information about the nature, definition, characteristics, or details of a specific concept or term. The core request is for an explanation of what this thing (gymnophobia) is.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format is not a simple fact (like a date or number), nor is it likely to be a list of entities or locations. Instead, the answer requires a detailed explanation, definition, or description of the concept of gymnophobia. It should provide information about *what* it means, its nature, and perhaps its causes or effects. The answer format is descriptive and explanatory in nature.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nThe key words are \"what\" and \"is\". \"What\" generally signals a request for definition, description, or identification of characteristics. \"Is\" often precedes explanations or definitions. The term \"gymnophobia\" itself is a concept or psychological term whose meaning needs elucidation. There are no indicators suggesting a request for a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation meaning.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"what is gymnophobia ?\" directly asks for an explanation or definition of the term \"gymnophobia\". This aligns perfectly with the definition of category C03 (\"description\"). Category C03 encompasses questions seeking explanations, definitions, or detailed information about a subject. The answer requires describing the concept, its nature, and providing details, rather than identifying a single entity, person, number, location, or abbreviation. While \"gymnophobia\" is a specific concept (which could loosely relate to \"entity\"), the *primary* information being sought is its definition and characteristics, making the description category the most appropriate fit based on the question's phrasing.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nBased on the analysis, the question is asking for a definition or detailed explanation of a psychological term. This clearly falls under the category of seeking descriptive information. I am highly confident in this classification.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

It specifically requests a numerical value representing the duration in years, indicating that the information sought is a quantitative measurement rather than a qualitative description or other types of data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question should be a numerical response, such as a specific number, a range of numbers, or a unit-based measurement (e.g., \"millions of years\" or \"it varies but typically takes thousands to millions of years\"). This suggests that the answer is expected to be data-driven, involving counts, measurements, or dates, rather than subjective opinions, definitions, or descriptive narratives.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many years,\" which directly references a quantity or measurement. The phrase \"do fossils take to form\" emphasizes a process that involves time, and \"years\" specifies the unit of measurement. These elements highlight a focus on numerical data, aligning with categories that deal with quantifiable information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how many years do fossils take to form?\" falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical value related to a measurement. The core of the query is to determine the time duration, which is a quantitative aspect. This contrasts with other categories: it is not about identifying a specific entity (C01), as it doesn't ask for what fossils are; it is not human-focused (C02), as it doesn't involve people; it is not a description or explanation (C03), as it seeks a specific number rather than detailed information; it is not location-based (C05), as it doesn't concern geographical places; and it is not abbreviation-related (C06), as it doesn't involve decoding acronyms. The direct request for \"how many years\" confirms that the answer will be numeric, making C04 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question is confidently classified as C04, as it aligns with the definition of numeric questions that require numerical responses.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

Specifically, it is asking for a geographical or spatial answer, as \"where\" implies a search for a place or coordinates. The subject, \"orinoco,\" likely refers to the Orinoco River, which is a well-known geographical feature. The core request is not about the nature of the Orinoco itself but about its location in the world.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format would typically involve a place name, a region, or a description of spatial information. For example, a response might be: \"The Orinoco River is located in South America, primarily in Venezuela and Colombia.\" This indicates that the answer is not numerical, descriptive, or focused on a person, but rather on spatial data.\n- The answer characteristics include specificity about location, such as countries, continents, or coordinates, which aligns with geographical or locational information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"where,\" which is a strong indicator of a location query. It directly asks for spatial information.\n- The phrase \"the orinoco\" refers to a proper noun that is commonly associated with a geographical entity (the Orinoco River). This word is not an abbreviation, not a human name, not a numeric term, and not a general description. It serves as the object of the location inquiry.\n- Other potential indicators include the use of \"is,\" which in this context modifies \"where,\" emphasizing the search for a place rather than a definition or quantity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"where is the orinoco?\" falls under category C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the geographical position or spatial details of the Orinoco River. The word \"where\" is a linguistic cue that points directly to locational information, such as a place, region, or coordinates.\n- According to the category description, C05 is for questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. This matches perfectly, as the Orinoco River is a specific geographical feature, and the question seeks its location.\n- To contrast with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity): While \"orinoco\" could be considered an entity (e.g., a river), the question is not asking about its definition, properties, or general characteristics but specifically about its location. Thus, it does not fit C01.\n  - C02 (human): There is no reference to people or human-related information, so this category is irrelevant.\n  - C03 (description): The question does not request an explanation, definition, or detailed account; it seeks a locational fact.\n  - C04 (numeric): No numbers, dates, or quantities are involved in the question or its answer.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): \"Orinoco\" is not an abbreviation or acronym; it is a full word referring to a geographical feature.\n- Therefore, the question is best classified under C05 due to its focus on spatial information and the direct use of \"where.\"\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure and key words (\"where\" and the geographical subject) unambiguously point to the location category, and there is no overlap with other categories based on standard question classification criteria."

The question focuses on retrieving a specific entity from the domain of arts and entertainment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer is likely a proper noun or a specific title, such as \"Man of La Mancha\" or another named Broadway musical. This format suggests a direct reference to an entity rather than a numerical value, descriptive text, location, or abbreviation.\n- Characteristics of the answer include being a named thing, possibly with a formal or common designation, and it should be concise and identifiable.

An entity category encompasses questions about particular things, such as works of art, books, or other named items, which is exactly what is being sought here.\n- The core of the question is to identify a named entity in the context of inspiration, meaning it requires knowledge of a specific musical title or reference. This is distinct from other categories:\n  - It is not C02 (human) because no individual or person is the focus; the question is about a musical, not a person.\n  - It is not C03 (description) because it does not ask for an explanation, definition, or detailed account; it seeks a direct identification.\n  - It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved; the answer is expected to be a name or title.\n  - It is not C05 (location) because the question does not pertain to a place or spatial information.\n  - It is not C06 (abbreviation) because it is not inquiring about the meaning of an acronym or initialism.\n- The inspiration part adds context but does not change the fundamental request for an entity; it simply specifies the type of entity (a Broadway musical) and its relationship to another entity (Don Quixote). Thus, the question is centered on retrieving a specific thing, solidifying its classification under C01.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C01\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly requests the identification of a specific Broadway musical, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an \"entity\" as per the category descriptions.

The core request is to explain the origin of the word \"jj\". This involves seeking historical, linguistic, or etymological details about how the word came into existence, its development over time, and any relevant background information. The word \"jj\" appears to be an abbreviation or a specific term, but the focus is on its origin rather than its definition or usage.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is descriptive, as the question asks for an explanation or detailed information. This could include a narrative, examples, historical context, or linguistic analysis. For instance, the response might involve breaking down the word's roots, how it was formed, or its evolution, rather than providing a simple fact, number, or direct definition. The answer should be comprehensive and explanatory, aligning with categories that deal with non-numeric or non-location-based inquiries.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"origin\" and \"word\". \"Origin\" specifically points to a request for historical or etymological information, which is inherently descriptive. The phrase \"what is the origin\" is a common indicator for questions seeking explanations or definitions, as opposed to factual data like numbers or locations. While \"jj\" might be an abbreviation (which could relate to C06), the question is not directly asking for its meaning but for its origin, shifting the focus to a broader descriptive inquiry. Other categories, such as C01 (entity) or C04 (numeric), do not fit because the question is not about a specific object or quantity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question belongs to category C03 (description) because it is explicitly asking for an explanation or detailed information about the word's history. Category C03 encompasses questions that require descriptive responses, such as definitions, explanations, or narratives. In this case, \"what is the origin\" demands a thoughtful, expansive answer that goes beyond simple identification. For example, if \"jj\" is an abbreviation, the origin might involve how it was coined, its cultural or contextual emergence, and related linguistic details—all of which are descriptive. This contrasts with:\n- C01 (entity): Questions about specific objects or concepts (e.g., \"what is a computer?\") might involve description but are often more focused on defining a thing.\n- C02 (human): No human element is present.\n- C04 (numeric): No numbers or dates are requested directly.\n- C05 (location): No geographical or spatial information is involved.\n- C06 (abbreviation): While \"jj\" could be an abbreviation, the question is not solely about its meaning (which is C06); it's about its origin, making it more descriptive.  \nThus, C03 is the most appropriate category as it captures the need for a detailed, explanatory response.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's core request for an origin explanation aligns perfectly with the descriptive nature of C03, and the analysis of key words and expected answer format supports this choice.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The characteristics of the expected answer include specificity to a person or people, with no need for numerical data, geographical details, or definitional explanations. This contrasts with categories like C04 (numeric) or C05 (location), which would require quantitative or spatial information, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"who,\" which is a pronoun specifically denoting a human subject, and \"founded,\" which is a verb associated with human actions, such as establishing or creating something. The phrase \"the people 's temple commune\" refers to an entity, but the question is centered on the human element implied by \"who.\" Other indicators include the direct reference to an individual or group of people, as opposed to inanimate objects or concepts. These elements align with the category C02, which is defined for questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, rather than entities, descriptions, numbers, locations, or abbreviations.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"who founded the people 's temple commune ?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it explicitly asks for information about a person or people who performed a foundational action. The word \"who\" is a linguistic cue that directs the query toward human subjects, as it cannot refer to non-human entities like objects or concepts. The term \"founded\" further reinforces this by describing an action typically attributed to humans, such as starting or organizing a group. In this case, \"the people 's temple commune\" is likely a reference to a historical or social entity, but the question is not seeking a description of the commune (C03), a number related to its founding (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is focused on identifying the human agent, which falls squarely under the \"human\" category as per the provided definitions. This classification is supported by similar examples, such as questions like \"who wrote the Constitution?\" which also target individuals.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and keywords consistently point to a human-related inquiry, with no ambiguity in the request for personal information."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what part of your body contains the corpus callosum?\" This is a query that seeks to identify a specific component or section of the human body that houses or includes the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is a well-known anatomical structure, so the question is focused on locating this entity within a broader bodily context. Essentially, it's asking for the name of a body part or system that contains the corpus callosum.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer should be a specific, named entity, such as \"brain\" or \"central nervous system,\" which is a noun phrase referring to a physical object or concept. The answer does not require a numerical value, a date, or a detailed explanation; it simply needs to identify the correct part of the body. The format is straightforward, expecting a concise response that directly names the entity, without any additional descriptive text or calculations.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include: \"part of your body,\" \"contains,\" and \"corpus callosum.\" \n\n- \"part of your body\" suggests a focus on a physical entity or component within the human body, indicating a question about an object or thing.\n- \"contains\" implies a relationship of inclusion or containment, pointing to a larger entity that holds the corpus callosum.\n- \"corpus callosum\" is a specific term for a biological structure, which is an entity in itself.\n\nThese elements align with the C01 category, as they involve asking about a particular thing (the corpus callosum) and the context in which it exists. There are no indicators of human-related information (C02), descriptive explanations (C03), numeric data (C04), spatial locations (C05), or abbreviations (C06).\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what part of your body contains the corpus callosum?\" is asking for a specific object or concept within the body that encompasses the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is a defined anatomical entity—a bundle of nerve fibers connecting the brain's hemispheres—so the query is centered on identifying the entity responsible for containing it. This falls under C01, \"entity,\" because it is inquiring about a specific thing (the part of the body) rather than a person, a definition, a number, a location, or an abbreviation. The question does not seek a definition or explanation (which would be C03), nor does it involve any quantitative aspect (C04) or geographical reference (C05). Instead, it directly asks for the name of an entity, making C01 the most appropriate classification. The corpus callosum itself is an entity, and the question is extending this to ask about its container, which is also an entity.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question clearly requests information about a specific object or concept within the body, fitting the C01 category.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The core request is to identify and list two countries based on their geographical relationship with Brazil. The question focuses on the spatial aspect of countries, specifically those that do not share a border, which involves understanding the layout of South American nations and their boundaries.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a list of two country names, such as \"Chile\" and \"Ecuador,\" or similar names of South American countries not bordering Brazil. The answer is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers or dates), not descriptive (e.g., no need for detailed explanations), not focused on people or individuals, and not about abbreviations. Instead, it requires identifying specific entities (countries) based on their location relative to Brazil. The answer is concise and factual, centered on geographical information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"south american countries,\" \"do not border,\" and \"brazil.\" \"South american countries\" refers to a geographical region, indicating a focus on locations. \"Do not border\" implies a spatial relationship, such as adjacency or non-adjacency, which is a core aspect of geographical or spatial information. There are no words suggesting numerical values (e.g., \"how many\"), definitions (e.g., \"what is\"), human elements (e.g., \"who\"), or abbreviations (e.g., \"what does X mean\"). These elements point away from other categories like C04 (numeric), C03 (description), C02 (human), or C06 (abbreviation).\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about geographical locations and spatial relationships. The phrase \"south american countries\" specifies a region, and \"do not border brazil\" defines a criterion based on spatial adjacency, which is a key characteristic of location-based inquiries. While the question mentions \"countries,\" which could be seen as entities under C01, the context here emphasizes their geographical positioning rather than their intrinsic properties or identities. For example, a question like \"what is the capital of Brazil?\" might fall under C01 (entity) as it focuses on a specific thing, but this question is about identifying countries based on their location relative to Brazil. Additionally, the question does not seek a definition, explanation, or numerical data, ruling out C03 (description) and C04 (numeric). It also does not involve people or human elements, so C02 (human) is not applicable. Finally, there are no abbreviations mentioned, so C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant. Thus, the spatial focus on places and boundaries aligns perfectly with the C05 category, which encompasses questions about geographical locations and spatial information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's core request for countries not bordering Brazil is fundamentally about geographical locations and spatial relationships, which directly matches the definition of C05."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"why do some clothing labels say 'use a nonchlorine bleach'?\" It is requesting an explanation for a specific practice observed on clothing labels. The focus is on understanding the reason or rationale behind the instruction to use nonchlorine bleach, rather than identifying a particular object, person, number, location, or abbreviation. This indicates a need for detailed, explanatory information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should provide a descriptive explanation, likely covering topics such as the chemical properties of chlorine bleach, its potential damage to fabrics, environmental concerns, or safety reasons. The response may include definitions or details about nonchlorine bleach alternatives, but it must be narrative and explanatory in nature. This contrasts with factual answers that might simply state a fact or a number, or concise definitions.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"why,\" which is a direct indicator of a question seeking reasons or explanations. The phrase \"use a nonchlorine bleach\" refers to a common instruction on labels, but the question is not asking for the definition of \"nonchlorine bleach\" or a specific entity; instead, it delves into the purpose or justification. This aligns with the description category, which involves questions that require elaborative responses.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation or detailed information about a phenomenon. It seeks to understand the underlying reasons for a statement on clothing labels, which involves providing context, causes, and effects. For instance, the answer might explain that chlorine bleach can degrade certain fibers, release harmful chemicals, or cause color fading, making nonchlorine bleach a safer or more appropriate choice. This type of inquiry is not about identifying a specific thing (C01), people (C02), numbers (C04), locations (C05), or abbreviations (C06). Instead, it requires a descriptive response that goes beyond simple facts to offer insight and detail.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's use of \"why\" and its focus on explanatory information clearly match the description category."

It directly asks for the name of a city, which implies a request for spatial or geographical details. The focus is on identifying a location rather than a person, concept, or other entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is a specific city name, such as \"Rome\" or \"Paris,\" which is a noun representing a geographical location. The answer format is typically a short, direct response (e.g., a single word or a brief phrase) and does not involve numbers, dates, definitions, or explanations. It is a factual query that requires retrieving a piece of information about a place.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"city\" and \"lives in.\" \"City\" explicitly refers to a geographical location, and \"lives in\" establishes a spatial relationship, indicating an inquiry about a place where someone resides. There are no words suggesting a person (like \"who\" or \"about\"), a number (like \"how many\" or \"date\"), a definition (like \"what is\"), or an abbreviation (like \"what does XX mean\"). This reinforces the focus on a location.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a geographical place. The core request is for the name of a city, which aligns with the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" While the question mentions \"maurizio pellegrin,\" who is a human, the main intent is not to seek information about the person (e.g., their biography or achievements) but rather the location associated with them. This is similar to questions like \"What city is that landmark in?\" or \"Where does [person] live?\" which are classified under location. The absence of any numerical, descriptive, or abbreviatory elements further supports this classification, as the question is straightforwardly seeking a spatial reference point.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly targets a city name, which is a clear indicator of the location category, and there is no overlap with other categories like human or description."

The focus is on finding a source or venue for the information, rather than on the content of the directions themselves.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a location, such as a physical place (e.g., a bookstore, a workshop), a digital location (e.g., a website, an online forum), or a specific reference point (e.g., a library section, a tutorial platform). The answer is likely to be descriptive of a place or set of coordinates in space, and it may include details like addresses, URLs, or names of locations. It does not require a numerical value, a definition, or a list of people, and it is not concerned with abbreviations or acronyms.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases in the question include \"where can I find,\" which is a direct indicator of a location-based inquiry. The word \"location\" is not explicitly stated, but the intent is clear: the user is seeking a place to obtain the information. Other elements, such as \"pictorial directions\" and \"treehouse,\" provide context but do not shift the question's focus away from the locational aspect. These keywords help identify that the question is not about the treehouse itself (an entity) or the directions (which might imply description, but the question is about finding them, not explaining them).\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for a place or location where information can be found. The category C05 encompasses questions that inquire about geographical, spatial, or reference-based locations, such as where to find specific items, resources, or information. In this case, the user is not asking for a definition (C03), a number (C04), details about people (C02), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, the core of the question is the search for a venue or site—whether physical, digital, or conceptual—where pictorial directions are available. For example, the answer might specify a website like Pinterest, a book store, or an online tutorial platform, all of which are locations. This aligns with the category description for C05, which focuses on spatial information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly matches the definition of a location-based inquiry and the given label."

It is not seeking identification, description, or other types of information. The core request is for a numerical count, indicating that the answer should be a number or a figure representing the total or approximate number of shark species.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer format is numerical, such as an integer, a range (e.g., \"approximately 500\"), or a specific number. The response should be concise and quantifiable, often involving data or statistics. It does not require descriptive text, explanations, or other non-numeric details. For example, an answer might be \"There are about 500 known species of sharks,\" where the key part is the number.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words include \"how many,\" which is a direct interrogative phrase for quantities. Additionally, \"species\" refers to a countable entity, and the question is focused on enumeration. These elements signal that the question is seeking a numeric response, aligning with categories that deal with numbers or measurements. There are no indicators of entities, humans, descriptions, locations, or abbreviations in the question.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question \"how many species of sharks are there ?\" falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a quantity or measurement. The use of \"how many\" is a clear linguistic cue for numeric queries, as it demands a numerical answer rather than a descriptive, categorical, or locative one. The subject matter—species of sharks—is countable, and the question is not seeking definitions (C03), locations (C05), or other details. For instance, if the question were \"What are the species of sharks?\" it might lean toward C01 (entity), but here, the focus is on the number, making it numeric. This classification is appropriate because the answer involves a specific count, which is a fundamental aspect of C04.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C04  \nConfidence statement: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly requests a numerical quantity using standard interrogative language, and it aligns perfectly with the definition of C04, which covers questions about numbers, dates, or quantities."

This is a straightforward inquiry about the quantity of individuals in the global population. The information being requested is a numerical value, such as a specific number or estimate, rather than a description, definition, or other type of information. The question focuses on counting or measuring something, which aligns with the need for a quantitative response.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is numerical, meaning it should be a number, possibly with units (e.g., billions, millions, or a specific figure). Characteristics of this format include the use of digits, statistics, or data points. The answer might be approximate due to the dynamic nature of population figures, but it is inherently numeric. There is no expectation for a descriptive or narrative response, as the question is direct and seeks a count.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many\" and \"people\". \"How many\" is a direct indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value, while \"people\" refers to the subject being counted. The phrase \"in the world\" provides context for the scope but does not alter the core request for a number. These elements collectively point towards a category involving numeric information, as opposed to descriptive, locational, or other types of queries.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how many people are there in the world ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity. The word \"how many\" is a clear signal that the answer requires a count or measurement, such as a population figure. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about identifying or describing \"people\" as an object or concept, but here it's about counting them.\n- C02 (human) focuses on people themselves, such as their characteristics or actions, but this question is not about that; it's about the number.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, which is not the case here, as the answer is expected to be a number.\n- C05 (location) deals with places or spatial information, but the question is not asking about where people are or geographical details.\n- C06 (abbreviation) involves decoding acronyms, which is irrelevant to this query.\nThe primary intent is to obtain a numeric value, making C04 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly invokes a request for a numerical answer, supported by the use of \"how many,\" which is unambiguous in indicating a quantity-based query."

It is not asking for general information about a person, place, or concept, but specifically seeks to understand what this sequence represents. The information requested is the definition or full form of the abbreviation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer format is textual, typically a phrase or words that explain the meaning of \"s o s\". For example, a common response would be \"Save Our Souls\" or \"Save Our Ship\", depending on the context. The answer does not involve numbers, dates, measurements, or other quantitative data, nor does it require a descriptive narrative. Instead, it provides a concise expansion of the abbreviation, which is characteristic of questions seeking clarification on acronyms or shortened forms.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words in the question include \"what does\" and \"stand for\". \"What does\" often signals a request for definition or explanation, while \"stand for\" specifically directs the query toward decoding an abbreviation or acronym. The term \"s o s\" is presented in a fragmented, letter-by-letter format, which is a common way to represent abbreviations or acronyms, further emphasizing that the question is about expanding a shortened form. These elements align with the category for abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question \"what does s o s stand for ?\" falls under category C06 (abbreviation) because it is explicitly asking for the meaning or expansion of a term that is recognized as an abbreviation. Abbreviations are condensed forms of words or phrases, often using initial letters, and the query seeks to provide that full meaning. In this case, \"s o s\" is a well-known distress signal abbreviation, and the answer would be a textual expansion, not a description, number, location, or entity. Other categories do not fit:\n  - C01 (entity) is for questions about specific objects or concepts, which is not the case here.\n  - C02 (human) relates to people or human-related topics, which is irrelevant.\n  - C03 (description) involves detailed explanations or definitions, but this question is focused on a specific abbreviation's meaning, not a broad description.\n  - C04 (numeric) requires numerical data, which is not requested.\n  - C05 (location) concerns geographical places, which is not applicable.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is the appropriate category as the question directly asks for the meaning of an abbreviation, and the expected answer is the expansion or definition.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Based on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for the meaning of an abbreviation, which matches the definition of C06.

The core request is for a list or description of four distinct forms, such as metallic gold, alloyed gold, or other mineralogical variations. The question focuses on gold as a subject, which is a specific object or concept, and seeks information about its occurrences.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer should provide a list or enumeration of four forms, as indicated by the phrase \"four forms.\" For example, responses might include terms like \"native gold,\" \"alloy,\" \"sulfide mineral,\" or similar specific entities. The answer format is not numerical, descriptive in a broad sense, or focused on definitions; instead, it requires identifying and naming particular instances or categories related to the entity in question. This suggests a response that is factual and entity-based, rather than explanatory or quantitative.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"gold,\" which is a specific entity (a chemical element or mineral), and \"forms,\" which refers to different types or states of that entity. The phrase \"what four forms\" directly requests information about particular objects or concepts. Comparing this to the category descriptions, C01 (\"entity\") is indicated by words that point to specific things or concepts, such as \"gold\" representing an object, and \"forms\" implying variations of that entity.

Gold is an entity, as defined in the category, which includes questions about specific objects, concepts, or things. The request for \"four forms\" seeks to identify particular entities (e.g., metallic gold, telluride gold, etc.), each of which is a distinct thing or category related to gold. This is not a human-related question (C02), as it doesn't involve people; not a description (C03), since it doesn't require an explanation or definition; not numeric (C04), as no numbers are involved; not location-based (C05), as it's not about places; and not abbreviation-focused (C06), as there's no acronym or short form being queried. The question's structure—asking for forms of a specific entity—aligns perfectly with C01, as it involves retrieving information about concrete or abstract entities associated with gold.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly references a specific entity (gold) and requests its forms, which are also entities, making it a clear fit for the C01 category based on the provided definitions and analysis."

The phrase \"who was\" indicates a request for a name or description of a human being. The core subject is the mother of Edward, Duke of Windsor (formerly Edward VIII), who abdicated the British throne. The question is not asking for a general concept or thing but specifically for biographical information about a person.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun (e.g., a name) or a brief description of a person. For instance, the answer might be \"Queen Alexandra\" or a similar reference, which is a human individual. The response should be concise and directly identify the person, as \"who\" questions typically elicit names or titles of people. There is no indication that the answer requires a number, date, location, or explanation, so the focus is on providing a human-centric response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases: \"who\" – This word is a direct indicator of a question about a person or entity, but in this context, it specifies a human subject. \"Mother\" – This term denotes a human relationship, emphasizing a person's familial connection. \"The man who would not be king, the duke of windsor\" – This refers to Edward, Duke of Windsor, a specific historical individual, reinforcing the human element. There are no words like \"what,\" \"where,\" \"how,\" or \"when\" that might suggest other categories, and no abbreviations or numeric elements are present.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question belongs to category C02 (\"human\") because it is explicitly asking about a person and their relationship. Category C02 encompasses questions that inquire about individuals, their identities, or human-related details, such as biographical information, family ties, or personal histories. In this case, the question focuses on identifying the mother of a specific human being (Edward, Duke of Windsor), which is a direct query about a person. \n- To determine this, we analyze the question's structure: It uses \"who\" to request a human subject, and the object of the question (\"the mother\") is inherently a human role. The phrase \"the man who would not be king, the duke of windsor\" provides context by identifying a specific individual, but the core inquiry is about a person (the mother). This aligns with the category description for C02, which includes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, as opposed to abstract concepts (C01), numerical data (C04), places (C05), or abbreviations (C06). \n- Furthermore, the expected answer format supports this classification, as it would involve naming or describing a human, not a location, number, or acronym. There are no elements that suggest a description (C03), such as asking for an explanation or definition, making C02 the most appropriate fit.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question's phrasing and content consistently point to a human subject, with no ambiguity or indicators of other categories. The use of \"who\" and references to familial relationships strongly align with the C02 category definition."

The core request is for spatial or informational location details, such as a physical address, online platform, database, or publication venue. It does not focus on the content of the review itself but on the context or place where it exists.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a location-based response, such as a specific website, library, journal issue, or database. For example, the answer might be something like \"in a university library's film studies section, on IMDb, or in a specific edition of the film journal.\" The response is likely to be descriptive and spatial, emphasizing where the information can be accessed, rather than a numerical value, definition, or explanation. It may involve multiple locations or sources, but the key characteristic is the focus on places or positions in space.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"where\" and \"can I find,\" which directly signal a search for location or spatial information. Additionally, \"film journal\" refers to a specific type of publication or resource, which could imply a physical or digital location, but it does not change the core intent of seeking a place. There are no words indicating a need for a definition, number, person, or abbreviation, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for a place or location where something (a review of \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" in a film journal) can be found. The word \"where\" is a strong indicator of a location-based query, as it seeks spatial or contextual information. The phrase \"can I find\" further emphasizes the need for a venue or source, such as a physical location (e.g., a bookstore or archive) or a digital one (e.g., an online database). While \"film journal\" might refer to a specific entity or publication, the question is not asking about the entity itself (which would be C01) but rather where to locate it, making it location-focused. This aligns with the C05 category description, which involves questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. Comparing to other categories:  \n- It is not C01 (entity) because the question is not about identifying what the review or movie is, but where it can be found.  \n- It is not C02 (human) because no people are mentioned or implied.  \n- It is not C03 (description) because the request is not for an explanation or detailed information about the review.  \n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.  \n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because there are no abbreviations or acronyms to decode.  \nThus, the question's focus on finding a location makes C05 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and keywords consistently point to a location-based inquiry, with no ambiguity in its intent."

The core request is for the identification of a particular disease, which is a type of concept or thing. The anopheles mosquito serves as a contextual element, but the primary focus is on retrieving a named entity (the disease). Therefore, the question type is one that asks about a specific object, concept, or thing, which aligns with the definition of an entity-based question.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a specific name or term, such as \"malaria\" or \"falciparum,\" which are diseases. It is not an open-ended explanation, a numerical value, a date, or a multi-word description. The answer is expected to be concise and factual, typically a noun or a short phrase representing a disease. This format suggests that the question is seeking direct information about an entity, rather than requiring elaboration, calculation, or contextual details.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"disease,\" which directly refers to a concept or thing (an entity), and \"anopheles mosquito,\" which is also an entity (a specific type of insect). The phrase \"transmitted by\" establishes a relationship, but the question is centered on identifying the disease, not the transmission mechanism. These keywords point to a query about a specific entity, as \"disease\" is a non-human, non-numeric, non-locational concept. There are no indicators of a human, number, location, or abbreviation in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific disease, which is a concept or thing. Diseases are abstract entities that fall under the \"entity\" category as defined in the category descriptions. The anopheles mosquito is mentioned as a contextual reference, but the question does not shift the focus to a description, numeric value, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it directly requests the identification of a particular disease, making it an entity-based query. This classification is supported by the absence of other category indicators: no human elements (C02), no need for explanation or definition (C03), no numerical or quantitative aspect (C04), no spatial or geographical focus (C05), and no abbreviation involved (C06). The question is straightforward and seeks a named entity, which is characteristic of C01.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question directly asks for a specific disease, which is an entity, and aligns with the provided correct label."

Despite potential typos or formatting issues (e.g., the backticks and quotes around \"mixable\"), the core of the question is asking for a specific rum that possesses certain characteristics. It is inquiring about an entity, specifically a type or brand of rum, that is described as \"mixable\" and associated with being \"a one brand bar\". The request is for identification or specification of the rum, which indicates a focus on finding a particular object or concept within the domain of beverages.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely to be a noun phrase or a specific name, such as a brand or type of rum (e.g., \"Mojito\" or \"Captain Morgan\"). This suggests a response that provides a direct identification, rather than a numerical value, descriptive explanation, or other formats. The characteristics of the answer include being concise and specific, as it aims to pinpoint an entity, and it should relate to the properties mentioned (e.g., mixability and the \"one brand bar\" reference). There is no indication that the answer requires a definition, date, location, or abbreviation, so the format is focused on naming or specifying an object.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"rum\", which is a specific object or concept (a type of alcoholic beverage), and the descriptors \"mixable\" and \"one brand bar\". The word \"rum\" directly points to an entity category, as it refers to a tangible or conceptual thing. The phrases \"so mixable\" and \"it is a one brand bar\" provide context but do not shift the question toward other categories; they are adjectives or descriptive elements that qualify the entity being sought. There are no words suggesting human involvement, numeric values, locations, or abbreviations. The formatting with backticks might be for emphasis, but it does not change the fundamental request for an entity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is fundamentally asking for the identification of a specific object or concept. The term \"rum\" is central to the query, as it refers to a distinct entity within the category of beverages. The additional phrases (\"so mixable\" and \"it is a one brand bar\") serve to define or qualify this entity, but they do not alter the core intent of seeking a particular thing. For instance, if the question were \"what is the capital of France?\", it would be asking for a location (C05), but here, the focus is on a specific rum, which is an object. This aligns with the C01 category description: questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things. There is no element of human-related information (C02), as no individuals are mentioned; no description or definition is requested (C03); no numbers or dates are implied (C04); and no abbreviations are involved (C06). The question is purely seeking an entity, making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that this question belongs to category C01 because it directly asks for the identification of a specific rum, which is an entity, and the descriptors provided do not shift it to other categories.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

This suggests the question is seeking a comprehensive breakdown of the ring's features.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question would be descriptive and explanatory. It likely involves a list, paragraph, or detailed explanation that covers the powers (e.g., flight, energy projection, willpower amplification) and weaknesses (e.g., dependence on willpower, vulnerability to emotional control) of the ring. The answer should provide context, examples, or lore-based details, rather than a single number, date, or short phrase.

This type of question is not seeking a definition of a concept or a description of an object, but rather biographical or personal information about a human being.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question is typically a narrative or descriptive response that provides details about the person, such as their full name, birthdate, career highlights, personal life, and other relevant facts. It is not a simple yes/no or numerical value, but rather a detailed explanation that could include dates, places, or achievements, all centered around the human subject. The answer format is subjective and informative, often involving a mix of facts and context, rather than a specific number, location, or abbreviation. This aligns with the nature of questions that focus on people rather than abstract concepts or data points.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"who is\" and \"terrence malick.\" The phrase \"who is\" is a direct indicator of a question about a person, as it implies an inquiry into identity, existence, or characteristics of an individual. \"Terrence Malick\" is a proper noun that functions as a specific human reference, likely denoting a real person (in this case, a famous director). There are no words or phrases that suggest numerical data (e.g., numbers or dates), geographical locations, or abbreviations. The absence of such elements helps rule out other categories like C04 (numeric) or C05 (location). The focus on \"who\" specifically points to human-related information, as opposed to general entities or descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who is terrence malick ?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it directly asks for information about a specific individual, which falls under the definition of questions that pertain to people, individuals, or human-related information. The phrase \"who is\" is a classic interrogative for biographical inquiries, and \"terrence malick\" is a human name, making the query centered on a person's life, profession, or background. For example, a response might include details like \"Terrence Malick is a renowned American film director and screenwriter, known for his philosophical and visually poetic films such as 'The Tree of Life' and 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'.\" This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply to questions about non-human things or concepts (e.g., \"what is AI?\"), but here the focus is on a person.\n- C03 (description) could involve detailed explanations, but it is broader and often used for defining terms or explaining processes, whereas this question is specifically tied to a human subject.\n- C04 (numeric), C05 (location), and C06 (abbreviation) do not fit, as there is no request for numbers, places, or acronym meanings in the question. The human category is the most precise fit because it exclusively deals with inquiries about individuals, and this question exemplifies that by seeking personal or professional details about Terrence Malick.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking about a person, and the classification C02 accurately reflects this. I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and key elements align perfectly with the definition of the human category.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

The core request is for specific entities—such as features, innovations, or external factors—that are attributed to its success. Essentially, it's asking for the key elements or objects that made Windows 3 successful.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format involves listing or describing specific entities, such as concepts, objects, or things (e.g., \"its innovative graphical user interface\" or \"compatibility with IBM PCs\"). The answer should be informative and factual, focusing on tangible or abstract entities rather than providing a numerical value, a definition, or a narrative explanation.

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"who was the 16th president of the united states?\" This query uses the pronoun \"who,\" which is a direct indicator of a question seeking information about a person or individual. Specifically, it is asking for the identity of a historical figure—the 16th president of the United States. The information being requested is not a general concept or object, but rather a specific human being, along with contextual details like their role or position. This suggests a focus on human-related information.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question is likely a proper noun or a name, such as \"Abraham Lincoln,\" or a short descriptive phrase identifying the person. It may include additional context, like their achievements or the time period, but the core response is centered on a human individual. The answer format is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers like birth dates or election years are required, though they might be implied), not descriptive (it's not asking for a detailed explanation or definition), not locational (it's not about a place), and not focused on abbreviations. The answer is typically concise and identifies a person, aligning with human-specific queries.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"who,\" which is a strong indicator of a human-related question, as it directly seeks personal identity. Additionally, \"the 16th president\" refers to a specific human role or position, emphasizing the focus on an individual. The phrase \"of the united states\" provides contextual background but does not shift the question away from human inquiry. Other notable elements include the ordinal number \"16th,\" which is a reference point but not the main focus, and the absence of words like \"what,\" \"how,\" \"where,\" or \"abbreviation\" that might point to other categories. These elements collectively highlight a query about a person.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who was the 16th president of the united states?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it directly asks for information about a specific individual, which falls under the category's definition of \"questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" The pronoun \"who\" is a classic cue for human-focused questions, and the reference to \"the 16th president\" specifies a well-known historical figure, Abraham Lincoln, reinforcing the human element. This contrasts with other categories:\n- **C01 (entity)**: While people can be considered entities, the category description for C01 is broader and includes non-human things (e.g., objects or concepts). However, the separate C02 category is explicitly for human-related queries, making it more precise here.\n- **C03 (description)**: This category involves seeking explanations or definitions, such as \"What is the presidency?\" but this question is not asking for a definition; it's asking for identification.\n- **C04 (numeric)**: The question does not request numbers, dates, or quantities; the \"16th\" is merely a positional reference.\n- **C05 (location)**: There is no focus on geographical places or spatial information; the question is about a person, not a location.\n- **C06 (abbreviation)**: No abbreviations or acronyms are involved; the query is straightforward and human-centric.\n\nThus, the question is best classified under C02 because it centers on identifying a person, and the category description aligns perfectly with the intent to seek human-related information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure, key words, and expected answer format consistently point to human-related inquiries, and there is no ambiguity in the query that would suggest another category."

The word \"when\" indicates a request for temporal information, such as a date, year, or specific event time. The core information being sought is the date of this directorship event.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., \"1975\") or a specific date (e.g., \"June 20, 1975\"). This is because the question is asking for a precise time point, which is inherently quantitative. The answer does not require a descriptive narrative, a list of entities, or any other format; it should be concise and numerical in nature, fitting the definition of a numeric question under category C04.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"when\", which is a direct indicator of temporal information, and \"direct\", which refers to an action or event. The phrase \" ` ` jaws ' '\" appears to be a formatting error or typo for \"Jaws\", which is a well-known movie entity. However, the focus of the question is not on the entity itself but on the timing of the event (directing it). Other key elements include the name \"Spielberg\", which refers to a person, but the question is not seeking biographical details; it's specifically about the date. These elements help identify that the question is not about a description, location, or abbreviation, but rather about a numerical date.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a date or time-related numerical value. The word \"when\" is a strong indicator of this category, as it seeks quantitative information like years, months, or specific dates. In this case, the answer would be a number representing the year or date when Spielberg directed \"Jaws\" (e.g., 1975). While the question mentions a person (Spielberg) and an entity (Jaws), the primary intent is to retrieve a numerical fact, not to describe the person, explain the movie, or discuss its location or abbreviation. This aligns with the category description for C04, which includes questions about dates, quantities, and measurements. The question does not fall into C01 (entity, as it's not about the movie itself), C02 (human, as it's not focused on Spielberg's life or characteristics), C03 (description, as it's not asking for an explanation), C05 (location, as it's not about a place), or C06 (abbreviation, as it's not about acronyms). Therefore, the classification is appropriate.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly requests a specific date or numerical time value, which is a core characteristic of category C04, and there are no elements in the question that suggest other categories."

Specifically, it seeks to identify the country that contains Budweis, which is a spatial query. The term \"European country\" explicitly points to a location within a defined region, and \"home to\" reinforces the idea of spatial containment. While the mention of \"beer producing city\" provides contextual detail about Budweis, it does not change the primary focus on the country's location. This aligns with the category description for C05, which includes questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. No other category fits as well: C01 (entity) might apply if the question was about Budweis itself, but it is not; C02 (human) is irrelevant as no people are mentioned; C03 (description) requires explanatory text, which is not requested; C04 (numeric) involves numbers, which are not part of the question; and C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms, which is not applicable here.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly asks for a geographical location and matches the definition of C05."

This is a query that seeks specific information about a geographical place associated with a historical figure. It is asking for the location of birth, which implies a spatial or geographical detail. The core request is to identify a place, such as a city, town, or country.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun representing a geographical location, such as \"Genoa\" or \"Italy\". The answer should be concise and factual, focusing on a specific place name or set of coordinates. It does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or an expanded definition. The format is straightforward and directly addresses the spatial aspect of the query.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"where\" and \"born\". \"Where\" is a strong indicator of a location-based question, as it typically prompts responses about places or spatial information. \"Born\" specifies the context of birth, which is inherently tied to a geographical location. There are no words suggesting numbers, definitions, people, or abbreviations, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it directly asks for a geographical place. The word \"where\" explicitly seeks spatial information, and \"born\" narrows it down to a birthplace, which is a type of location. This aligns with the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In contrast:  \n- It is not C01 (entity) because while Christopher Columbus is an entity, the question is not about him in general but specifically about his birthplace.  \n- It is not C02 (human) because the focus is on the location rather than human-related details about Columbus.  \n- It is not C03 (description) because it does not request an explanation or definition; it seeks a factual location.  \n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.  \n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because there are no abbreviations or acronyms being asked about.  \nThus, the question is best classified as a location query due to its direct request for a place.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to the location category."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"what do italians call florence ?\". This is a query that seeks the specific term or name used by Italians to refer to the city of Florence. The core information being requested is the linguistic or cultural designation for this entity, which implies a focus on the identity or representation of Florence. Florence itself is a well-known city, so the question is not about its existence or general facts but about how it is named or referred to within a specific context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question is likely a word or phrase, such as \"Firenze\", which is the Italian name for Florence. This suggests a textual response that represents a specific term, name, or label. The answer does not require a numerical value, date, explanation, or abbreviation; it is a straightforward piece of information about the entity. The format is concise and direct, focusing on the entity's identity rather than descriptive details or quantitative data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases in the question include \"what do italians call\", which directly relates to terminology, naming, or reference. The word \"call\" implies a question about how something is designated or named, pointing to a conceptual or object-focused inquiry. The entity \"Florence\" is central to the question, as it is the specific thing being referred to. Other words like \"italians\" provide context but do not change the core focus on the entity itself. These elements align with categories that deal with specific objects or concepts, rather than people, descriptions, numbers, locations exclusively, or abbreviations.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what do italians call florence ?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is fundamentally asking for the name or term associated with a specific entity—Florence. An entity, as defined in the categories, refers to questions about specific objects, concepts, or things. Here, Florence is an entity (a city), and the question is seeking its designation in a particular language or cultural context. While Florence is also a location (C05), the question is not primarily about its geographical or spatial attributes but about its naming, which is a characteristic of the entity itself. This makes C01 the most appropriate category, as it encompasses questions about the identity, reference, or representation of specific things. For example, a question like \"what is the Eiffel Tower?\" would also fall under C01, as it seeks information about a specific entity. The answer format (a name or term) further supports this, as it is not a description, numeric value, or abbreviation. Although the question involves human context (\"itallians\"), it does not shift the focus to C02 (human), as no individual or human-related information is central. Overall, the question is entity-focused due to its emphasis on the specific reference to Florence.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01 with high confidence, as the question clearly targets the identification or naming of a specific entity, aligning perfectly with the definition provided.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

It is not seeking a simple fact, such as the tower's height or location, but rather a step-by-step explanation or guide on how to reach it. The request involves practical information, such as transportation options, ticket requirements, or physical actions like using stairs or elevators. This indicates that the question is focused on obtaining detailed instructions or a description of an action.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question would be a descriptive, explanatory response, likely including multiple steps, details about time, cost, or safety considerations. For example, an answer might cover purchasing tickets, choosing between stairs or elevators, or historical context. The format is not numerical (e.g., a number or date) or a simple definition; instead, it requires a narrative or instructional style. This suggests the answer is meant to provide comprehensive information, aligning with categories that involve explanations or detailed descriptions.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"how do you get,\" which is a common phrase for questions seeking methods, procedures, or explanations. Additionally, \"to the top of the eiffel tower\" refers to a specific location or object, but the focus is on the action of getting there, not on identifying the tower itself. Phrases like \"how do you\" often signal a request for descriptive information, such as instructions or definitions. In contrast, words like \"what is\" or \"where is\" might point to other categories, but here the intent is clearly about explaining a process.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C03 - description because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information on how to perform an action. The core of the query is not about identifying an entity (like the Eiffel Tower as an object), a human element, a numerical value, a location, or an abbreviation. Instead, it seeks a step-by-step description of the process to reach the top, which falls under the \"description\" category. For instance, an answer might describe the elevator options, the number of stairs, or visitor guidelines, all of which are explanatory in nature. This contrasts with C01 (entity), which would involve questions about the tower's structure or history without focusing on access; C02 (human), which might involve people-related aspects like staff roles; C04 (numeric), which could ask for specific numbers like the height or visitor capacity; C05 (location), which would focus on the tower's address or map; and C06 (abbreviation), which deals with acronyms. Thus, the question's intent for detailed, instructional information aligns perfectly with C03.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is confidently classified under C03, as it directly requests a descriptive explanation of how to access the top of the Eiffel Tower, which matches the category's focus on providing detailed information or instructions.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n- The question is \"what does ` psi ' stand for ?\". This is a query that seeks the meaning or expansion of the term \"psi\", which is enclosed in backticks to emphasize it as a specific term. The phrase \"what does ... stand for\" is a common idiomatic expression used to ask for the definition or full form of an abbreviation or acronym. Therefore, the question type is focused on seeking the interpretation of a shortened form, and the information requested is the complete meaning or expansion of \"psi\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a textual explanation or definition, such as \"Pounds per Square Inch\" or \"Psycho\", depending on the context. It is not expected to be a numerical value, a date, a list of items, or a spatial description. The answer is characterized by being a string of words that expands the abbreviation, rather than a number, a location, or a broad explanation. This suggests the answer is concise and directly addresses the abbreviation's meaning.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases include \"what does ... stand for\", which is a direct indicator of a query about abbreviations or acronyms. The backticks around \"psi\" further highlight that \"psi\" is a specific term likely to be an abbreviation (e.g., \"psi\" commonly refers to \"Pounds per Square Inch\" in physics or \"Psycho\" in informal contexts). Other potential categories can be ruled out based on the language: no mention of people, objects, locations, numbers, or general descriptions is implied. The focus is solely on expanding the abbreviation.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what does ` psi ' stand for ?\" should be classified under category C06 (abbreviation) because it directly asks for the meaning of an abbreviation or acronym. The category description for C06 explicitly states that it involves questions seeking the meaning of abbreviations or acronyms, which aligns perfectly with the query's intent. The phrase \"what does ... stand for\" is a standard way to request such expansions, and \"psi\" is a prime example of an abbreviation that requires clarification. In contrast:\n  - It does not fit C01 (entity) because it is not asking about a specific object or concept in general; it is focused on the abbreviation itself.\n  - It does not fit C02 (human) because there is no reference to people or human-related information.\n  - It does not fit C03 (description) because while the answer might involve a definition, the specific nature of the question is to expand an abbreviation, not to provide a general explanation or definition.\n  - It does not fit C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are being requested.\n  - It does not fit C05 (location) because no geographical or spatial information is involved. Thus, the question is precisely about abbreviations, making C06 the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C06\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure and key phrases unambiguously point to the abbreviation category, and the correct label provided matches this analysis."

It does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, a date, or a multi-part response. The answer format is concise and focused on providing the exact term, aligning with a straightforward identification of a concept rather than elaboration or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"term\", \"bet\", and \"before cards are dealt\". \"Term\" suggests a word or name for something, pointing to a definitional or categorical inquiry. \"Bet\" refers to an object or action in a game context. \"Before cards are dealt\" provides contextual specificity, narrowing it to a particular type of bet in card games. These elements highlight a search for a specific concept or thing, rather than information about people, places, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for the name or definition of a specific object or concept. In this case, the query seeks the term for a bet that occurs before cards are dealt, which is a distinct entity in card games (e.g., an \"ante\" in poker). This fits the C01 category as it involves identifying a thing or idea, not a person (C02), a detailed explanation (C03), a numerical value (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The question is not seeking a human-related aspect, such as a player or dealer, nor is it asking for spatial or quantitative data. Instead, it is focused on retrieving a named entity, making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question clearly requests a specific term for a concept, which aligns perfectly with the C01 category definition."

The information being requested is which of the two entities—either the chicken or the egg—existed or came into being first, based on the biblical account. The question focuses on comparing and identifying these specific items in a narrative context.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format would likely be a direct response indicating which entity (chicken or egg) came first, potentially with a brief explanation or reference to the Genesis text. However, the core output is not a number, date, or location; instead, it involves naming or specifying a particular thing or concept. The answer could be phrased as \"the egg\" or \"the chicken,\" or it might include details from Genesis, but the essence is to identify or discuss the entities involved. This suggests an answer format that is descriptive or referential, rather than quantitative or spatial.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"chicken,\" \"egg,\" and \"according to genesis 1 2 22.\" These terms refer to specific objects or concepts: \"chicken\" and \"egg\" are tangible entities, while \"Genesis 1:22\" is a reference to a biblical entity (a text or narrative). The phrase \"which came first\" indicates a comparison between these entities, and the context of Genesis provides a framework for the question. These elements point to a focus on identifying or explaining specific things, aligning with the \"entity\" category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C01 (\"entity\") because it is primarily asking about specific objects or concepts—namely, the chicken and the egg. These are concrete entities that can be defined or discussed in detail. The reference to Genesis 1:22 adds a contextual layer, but it does not change the core nature of the query, which is to determine the primacy of one entity over another in a creation narrative. The expected answer involves specifying or explaining which entity came first, which is characteristic of an entity-focused question. In contrast, this question does not seek a numeric value (e.g., a count or measurement), a location (e.g., a place or spatial reference), a description (e.g., an explanation or definition), or an abbreviation (e.g., the meaning of a shortened form).

    "text": "what are the 7 articles of the constitution ?",
    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is \"what are the 7 articles of the constitution ?\". This is an inquiry about specific components of a document, namely the articles within a constitution. The core request is for the identification and possibly the content of these articles, which are distinct parts of the constitution. The mention of \"7\" provides a specific number, but the primary focus is on the articles themselves, which are objects or concepts being sought. This suggests the question is not about a general definition or a single piece of information, but rather about retrieving specific details on defined entities.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer would likely be a descriptive list or explanation of the 7 articles, such as what each article covers or what they collectively represent. For instance, in the context of the US Constitution, the answer might include numbered articles detailing the structure of government, rights, and processes. The format could involve bullet points, numbered lists, or detailed descriptions, but it is not expected to be a single number, date, or abbreviation. The answer is inherently informational and focused on the content of the articles, which are specific entities.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words in the question include \"articles\" and \"constitution\". \"Articles\" typically refer to specific sections or components of a document, which are objects or concepts. \"The constitution\" is a document itself, which is an entity. The phrase \"what are\" indicates a request for information about these entities, similar to asking for details on specific things. There are no words suggesting a person (e.g., names), a location (e.g., places), a numeric quantity beyond context (the \"7\" is just a qualifier), or an abbreviation (no acronym or short form is being queried). These elements point toward the C01 category, which deals with specific objects or concepts.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what are the 7 articles of the constitution ?\" is asking for information about specific entities within a constitutional document. The articles are distinct, identifiable components (e.g., Article I, II, etc., which deal with specific aspects like legislative powers or executive functions). This fits the C01 category (\"entity\") because it is inquiring about particular objects or concepts— the articles themselves—rather than seeking a general explanation, a numerical value, a location, or the meaning of an abbreviation. While the answer might involve descriptive elements, the primary goal is to identify and describe these entities, making it a question about specific things. It does not involve human elements (C02), as no individuals are mentioned; it is not purely descriptive (C03), as the focus is on the entities rather than a broad explanation; it is not numeric (C04), since the \"7\" is contextual and not the core request; and it is not location-based (C05) or abbreviation-focused (C06). Therefore, the classification aligns with C01.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking about specific objects or concepts (the articles of the constitution), which directly matches the C01 category. I am confident in this classification with high certainty, as the key elements of the question consistently point to entities without ambiguity.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The word \"who\" indicates a focus on people, and the context suggests it is asking about human figures such as players, coaches, or team leaders who have achieved this feat. The information requested is not a general explanation or a numerical value but rather the names or identities of the people involved.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a list of names or a specific individual(s) who have won the most Super Bowls. For example, responses might include names like \"Pittsburgh Steelers\" (though this is a team, the question uses \"who,\" which could imply human interpretation), or more accurately, figures like Joe Gibbs or Tom Brady if the question is framed that way. The answer may implicitly involve a number (e.g., \"Tom Brady has won 6 Super Bowls\"), but the core output is human-centric, focusing on identification rather than pure quantification. Characteristics include a direct reference to people, with potential for multiple entities, and the answer should be concise and name-based.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"who,\" which is a direct indicator of a human-focused query, as it specifically refers to people. Additionally, \"has won\" implies an action performed by individuals, and \"the most super bowls\" refers to a competitive achievement attributed to humans. There are no words suggesting a location, abbreviation, or purely descriptive/explanatory need. The phrase \"super bowls\" is a proper noun referring to events, but the question's framing around \"who\" shifts the focus to the human agents involved.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who has won the most super bowls ?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it directly inquires about individuals or human entities associated with a specific achievement. The word \"who\" is a linguistic marker that points to human subjects, as it asks for the identity of people rather than objects, concepts, or places. In this context, Super Bowls are events, but the question is seeking out the human figures (e.g., players, coaches, or team representatives) who have won them the most times. This aligns with the C02 category definition: \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" \n\nIn contrast:\n- C01 (entity) would apply to questions about objects or concepts, such as \"What is a Super Bowl?\" but this question is not about defining or describing an entity.\n- C03 (description) would involve explanatory or definitional responses, like \"Describe the Super Bowl,\" but here the focus is on identifying specific humans.\n- C04 (numeric) would require a numerical answer, such as \"How many Super Bowls has the Steelers won?\" but this question is primarily about who, not what number.\n- C05 (location) is irrelevant, as there is no spatial or geographical element.\n- C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as no abbreviations are mentioned.\n\nThe question's intent is to retrieve information about human achievements, making C02 the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly uses \"who\" and focuses on human-related information, which is a clear match for the C02 category."

The information requested is not about a general concept or object but is focused on deciphering the abbreviation itself.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a concise explanation or phrase that provides the meaning of the abbreviation. For example, a common response would be \"National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations\". This format is typically short, factual, and directly addresses the expansion of the acronym. It does not involve numerical values, detailed narratives, or other types of information, as the question is specifically targeted at abbreviation meanings.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what does ... stand for?\" This phrasing is a standard indicator for questions related to abbreviations or acronyms. Additionally, \"nasdaq\" itself is a well-known abbreviation, which further supports this categorization. Other elements, such as the absence of words related to entities, humans, locations, or numbers, help rule out other categories. For instance, \"stand for\" is a direct cue for seeking an abbreviation's expansion.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what does nasdaq stand for ?\" should be classified under category C06 (abbreviation) because it directly asks for the meaning or expansion of an acronym. The category description for C06 explicitly states that it involves questions asking for the meaning of abbreviations or acronyms, which aligns perfectly with this query. The phrase \"stand for\" is a common linguistic marker for abbreviation-related questions, as it seeks to clarify shortened forms of words or phrases. In contrast, other categories do not fit:\n- C01 (entity) is for questions about specific objects or concepts, but this question is not inquiring about an entity in general; it's focused on the abbreviation.\n- C02 (human) involves people or human-related topics, which is irrelevant here.\n- C03 (description) could involve explanations, but the specific wording points to abbreviation meaning rather than a broad description.\n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers or measurements, which is not applicable.\n- C05 (location) concerns geographical places, and \"nasdaq\" is not a location. Thus, the question fits squarely within C06 due to its focus on abbreviation meaning.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C06  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and wording unambiguously indicate a request for abbreviation meaning, matching the category definition precisely."

This is an inquiry seeking a specific answer about a type of vehicle. The core request is to identify the automobile that holds the title of being the fastest among commercial options available for purchase in the United States. It is not asking for a general explanation, a numerical value, a location, or an abbreviation, but rather for the identification of a particular object or thing. The question focuses on a concrete entity—the automobile—rather than abstract concepts or other categories.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format would likely be a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Bugatti Chiron\" or \"Saleen S7\", which represents a tangible object. The answer might include contextual details (e.g., its speed or availability), but the primary output is the identification of the entity. This contrasts with categories like C04 (numeric), where the answer would be a number, or C03 (description), where the answer would be an explanation. The answer is expected to be a reference to a specific thing, not a definition, date, or location.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"automobile,\" which is a specific object, and \"commercial,\" which modifies the type of entity being sought. The phrase \"fastest\" indicates a comparative attribute, but it is still tied to the entity itself. Other phrases like \"can be bought in the us\" provide contextual constraints but do not shift the focus to a different category (e.g., location or human). The word \"what\" often signals a question about identification or existence of an entity, reinforcing C01.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object or thing—the commercial automobile. The query seeks to identify which particular automobile meets the criterion of being the fastest that can be purchased in the US, making it an entity-based question. While the question involves attributes like speed and availability, the primary information being sought is the entity itself, not a numerical value, description, location, or abbreviation. For example:\n- It is not asking for a person (C02), as no human is involved.\n- It is not seeking a definition or explanation (C03), as the answer is not about what an automobile is but which one it is.\n- It is not focused on numbers or measurements (C04), even though speed is a factor, because the core request is for the entity, not the speed value.\n- It is not about a place (C05), as the \"US\" is merely contextual and not the main subject.\n- It is not inquiring about an abbreviation (C06), as no acronym or shortened form is mentioned.\n\nThus, the question aligns with C01 by centering on the identification of a specific thing with defined characteristics.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question directly matches the definition of C01 by requesting information about a specific object or concept."

It is not asking about the team's history, players, or other attributes, but rather a specific spatial or physical location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a descriptive phrase that names a specific stadium or location, such as \"Hard Rock Stadium\" or \"a stadium in Miami, Florida.\" The answer may include details like the address or city, but it fundamentally involves providing a place-based response. This format is concise and factual, focusing on identifying a geographical or spatial entity rather than offering an explanation, definition, or numerical data.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words and phrases include \"stadium,\" \"Miami Dolphins,\" \"home games,\" and \"play their home games in.\" \"Stadium\" is a specific type of location (a sports venue), and \"play their home games in\" directly references a place where events occur. The phrase \"Miami Dolphins\" refers to an entity, but the question is not centered on the team itself; instead, it shifts focus to the location associated with the team. This use of location-specific language aligns with the \"location\" category, which emphasizes spatial or geographical information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is explicitly asking for information about a place or venue. The core of the query is to identify the physical location where the Miami Dolphins play their home games, which is a geographical or spatial entity. This differs from other categories: it is not about a general concept or object (C01, entity), as it specifies a real-world location; it is not focused on people or individuals (C02, human); it is not seeking an explanation or definition (C03, description); it is not asking for numerical data like dates or quantities (C04, numeric); and it is not inquiring about abbreviations (C06, abbreviation). The language used, such as \"play their home games in,\" strongly indicates a need for spatial information, making C05 the most appropriate fit.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C05\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly seeks a specific location (a stadium), which aligns perfectly with the category description for C05, and the key elements of the query reinforce this categorization."

It does not request a specific object or concept (C01), a human-related aspect (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it seeks a descriptive response that covers the reasons behind the variation, such as how diet, hydration, or medical factors influence the color of feces. This aligns with the definition of C03, which encompasses questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed breakdowns of topics. The use of \"why\" emphasizes the need for a descriptive analysis, making C03 the most appropriate fit.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key words clearly indicate a request for an explanatory or descriptive response, which is the core of category C03."

It is inquiring into the origin or basis of the term \"teddy,\" which is being described as an affectionate form or diminutive of a full name. The core request is to identify the underlying name associated with \"teddy\" in a human context, likely implying a proper noun or common nickname used for girls.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as a specific girl's name (e.g., \"Theodora,\" \"Dorothy,\" or another common name). It may be a single word or a short phrase, but it should not include numerical values, detailed explanations, geographical references, or definitions. The answer is expected to be concise and directly related to a human identity, focusing on the name itself rather than its meaning, history, or other attributes. This suggests a straightforward identification rather than a descriptive or analytical response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"girl's name\" and \"affectionate form.\" \"Girl's name\" directly references human-related information, as it pertains to a personal identifier for a female individual. \"Affectionate form\" implies a nickname or diminutive, which is commonly used in human contexts (e.g., for people's names). These terms do not align with categories like C01 (entity, which is broader and could include non-human things), C03 (description, which involves explanations), C04 (numeric, which deals with numbers), C05 (location, which involves places), or C06 (abbreviation, which focuses on acronyms or shortened forms). Instead, they point to a human-specific inquiry.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under C02 \"human\" because it is fundamentally asking about a person's name or a nickname associated with a human being. The term \"girl's name\" explicitly indicates a focus on human identity, as names are attributes of individuals. Additionally, \"affectionate form\" suggests a context where \"teddy\" is derived from or used as a shortened version of a girl's full name, which is a common human-related concept (e.g., nicknames like \"Teddy\" for \"Theodora\"). This does not fit other categories: C01 (entity) is too broad and could include non-human entities, but here the entity is specifically tied to a human; C03 (description) would require a detailed explanation, but the question seeks a direct identification; C04 (numeric) involves numbers, which are not present; C05 (location) deals with places, irrelevant here; and C06 (abbreviation) focuses on meanings of abbreviations, but \"teddy\" is being asked about as a name, not necessarily as an acronym. Therefore, the question is centered on human-related information, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C02 with high confidence, as the question consistently references human names and nicknames, aligning perfectly with the category's focus on people and individual identities."

It is not a description (C03) seeking an explanation or definition, though the answer might be descriptive, as the primary focus is on the method for interacting with the wallpaper. It is not numeric (C04), as it does not request quantities, measurements, or dates. It is not location-based (C05), as it does not concern geographical places or spatial information. Finally, it is not an abbreviation (C06), as there is no acronym or shortened form involved. The question is fundamentally about the entity of wallpaper and the concept of removing it, making C01 the appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the classification is correct, as the question aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, focusing on a specific object and its handling process.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The core information being requested is the identification of a U.S. state, which is a geographical entity. The question focuses on locating or identifying a place based on a specific attribute.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun representing a U.S. state, such as \"California\" or \"Montana\". It is not a numerical value, date, explanation, or abbreviation. The answer format is straightforward and categorical, as it requires naming a specific location. This suggests that the question is seeking a direct reference to a place, rather than a descriptive or quantitative response.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"U.S. state\" and \"element named for it\". \"U.S. state\" explicitly refers to a geographical location within the United States, indicating a spatial or place-based inquiry. The phrase \"named for it\" adds context but does not change the fundamental request for a location. Other potential keywords like \"state\" reinforce the idea of a defined territory or administrative division. These elements align with the category description for C05, which involves questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what u s state has an element named for it?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about a geographical entity—a U.S. state. While the question mentions \"element named for it,\" this is secondary to the core request, which is to identify a specific place. Category C05 encompasses questions that seek information about places, including their names, characteristics, or associations with other things. In this case, the question is not focused on an entity (like a mineral or concept), a human, a description, a numeric value, or an abbreviation. Instead, it is directly inquiring about a location by asking for a state that has an element named after it. This makes it a spatial information query, fitting the definition of C05.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C05 with high confidence.\n\nFinal classification: C05"

The core request is for identification of an entity (a company) performing a specific function.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a specific company (e.g., \"Certified Ballot Counting Services\" or a similar corporate name). However, the question's phrasing (\"tabulates the ballots...\") implies a need to understand *which* company performs this specific, non-standard task, suggesting the answer might involve more than just the company name. It could require identifying the company and potentially contextualizing its role.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases include \"what company\" (indicating an entity search) and \"tabulates the ballots in voting for the academy awards\" (describing a specific, non-obvious function). While \"company\" points towards an entity, the context of the function (tabulating ballots for a prestigious event) suggests the user wants to know *which specific company* handles this unique process, which often requires looking up or recalling a named organization responsible for that specific task.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nAlthough the question explicitly asks for a \"company\" (an entity), the category C02 (\"description\") is appropriate here. The reason is that the question is not merely seeking a generic entity but a specific one known for performing a particular, specialized function (ballot tabulation for the Oscars). This requires identifying a named organization, but the *nature* of the information sought (which company does this specific job?) often necessitates a descriptive answer that might include the company's name as part of a more detailed explanation or factoid about its role. The focus is on pinpointing the *specific entity* responsible for this particular task, which falls under the broader umbrella of seeking detailed information about a concept or process involving an entity. While C01 (\"entity\") might seem closer due to the direct request for a company name, the context implies a need to identify a specific, named entity performing a defined action, which aligns with the C02 category's emphasis on seeking detailed information or explanations about things, including identifying specific organizations involved in processes.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02"

The focus is on understanding the \"how,\" which implies a narrative or descriptive response.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a detailed, explanatory text. It should provide a step-by-step account, historical context, or reasoning that describes how the tradition began. This could include elements like dates, key figures, or cultural influences, but the primary output is descriptive in nature. It is not expected to be a simple fact, a numerical value, or a concise definition, but rather a comprehensive explanation that elaborates on the topic.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how did ... start?\" which is a common interrogative phrase used to request an explanation or description of an event's beginning. The word \"tradition\" refers to a cultural or historical concept, and \"best man\" is a specific entity within that context. However, the question is not focused on identifying what a best man is (which might be an entity) or who started it (which could imply human involvement), but rather on the descriptive aspect of its origin. There are no words indicating a numerical query, location, or abbreviation, which helps rule out other categories.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how did the tradition of best man start?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is seeking an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the origin of a tradition. The phrase \"how did ... start?\" explicitly asks for a narrative or descriptive account, which aligns with the category description for C03: \"Questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information.\" While \"best man\" could be considered an entity (C01), the question is not inquiring about the entity itself but about its historical development. Similarly, it is not human-focused (C02) because it doesn't center on individuals, nor is it numeric (C04) as it doesn't ask for numbers or measurements, location (C05) as it doesn't reference places, or abbreviation (C06) as it doesn't involve acronyms.

The information being requested is a geographical feature or region, which implies a spatial or locational answer. This suggests the question is seeking a named place or area rather than a general concept or abstract idea.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a descriptive phrase that names a specific location, such as \"the Denmark Strait\" or \"the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge.\" While the question includes the word \"deepest,\" which might imply a numeric component (e.g., depth in meters), the core request is for the area itself, not the measurement. The answer is expected to be a reference to a place, which is typically categorical and not purely numerical. This format aligns with providing a location-based response.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"deepest area\" and \"Arctic Ocean.\" \"Area\" refers to a spatial concept, and \"Arctic Ocean\" is a specific geographical location. The phrase \"deepest area\" highlights the search for a particular spot within that location, emphasizing spatial information. These keywords point to a category involving places or spatial entities, rather than entities, humans, descriptions, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question is asking for the deepest area within the Arctic Ocean, which directly seeks a specific geographical location. The Arctic Ocean is a well-defined body of water, and the deepest area is a sub-location within it, such as a trench or basin. This fits the category C05 (location), as it involves spatial information and the identification of a place. While \"deepest\" might suggest a numeric aspect (e.g., depth measurement), the question is primarily focused on the area itself, not the numerical value. Categories like C04 (numeric) would apply if the question asked for a number, such as \"what is the depth of the Arctic Ocean?\" but here, the emphasis is on the location. Other categories do not fit: C01 (entity) is for objects or concepts, not spatial places; C02 (human) involves people, which is irrelevant; C03 (description) requires explanations, not factual locations; and C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms, which are not present. Thus, the question is best classified under C05 for its focus on geographical spatial information.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly requests a specific location within a geographical context, matching the definition of C05."

Halloween is a holiday or event, and the question specifically asks for the colors, which are likely referring to the traditional or common colors used in Halloween decorations, costumes, or themes. The information being requested is about specific colors, such as orange and black, which are objects or concepts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format would involve listing or describing specific colors. For example, a typical response might include colors like orange and black, or perhaps a brief explanation of why those colors are associated with Halloween. The answer is not expected to be a single number, date, or location, but rather a set of entities (colors) or a descriptive list. This suggests the answer is informational and focused on defining or identifying specific things.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what are\" and \"halloween 's colors\". \"what are\" is an interrogative that often seeks information about objects or concepts. \"Halloween 's colors\" refers to a possessive relationship, where \"Halloween\" is the context and \"colors\" is the specific thing being asked about. \"Colors\" are tangible or conceptual entities, and the question is not about people, definitions, numbers, locations, or abbreviations.

Halloween itself is an event, but the question is not about the event itself or human-related aspects; it is about the colors, which are entities. For instance, if the answer were \"Orange and black are common Halloween colors,\" it directly provides information about entities. The category description for C01 states that it involves questions about specific objects, concepts, or things, which matches here.

The word \"who\" indicates that the question is focused on an entity, likely a person or individual, and the context suggests a human or human-like being is being referenced. The core request is to name or describe the person who performed this action.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer would typically be a name or a descriptive phrase referring to a human being. For example, in a biblical context, the answer might be \"Noah,\" as he is traditionally associated with building an ark from gopher wood. The answer format is not numerical, locational, or abbreviated; it involves identifying a person and may include brief contextual details, but the primary output is human-centric information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words include \"who,\" which explicitly signals a question about a person or human entity. Phrases like \"made a boat\" imply an action performed by an individual, and \"gopher wood\" provides context but does not shift the focus away from the human agent.

Additionally, the mention of \"screensaver\" specifies the item being sought, but the \"where\" aspect dominates, pointing to C05 (location). The term \"Fifth Element\" could be interpreted as an entity (C01), but the question is not asking about its nature or identity; it is focused on its location. There are no abbreviations or numeric elements, so C06 or C04 are not relevant. The word \"find\" reinforces the search for a place or access point.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question is classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the place or source where the \"Fifth Element\" screensaver can be obtained. The phrase \"where can I find\" is a common linguistic marker for location-based inquiries, seeking spatial or locational information rather than descriptive, numeric, or entity-specific details. While \"Fifth Element\" might refer to a cultural entity (potentially C01), the question's focus on \"finding\" it shifts the emphasis to its location, such as a software archive, a website, or a physical retailer.

The core request is for a numerical value or range that represents the typical heart rate for a healthy adult at rest. It is not asking for a general explanation, a list of entities, or other types of information. The focus is on obtaining a quantifiable answer.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a number or a numerical range, often accompanied by units (e.g., beats per minute). For instance, a common response might be \"60 to 100 beats per minute\" or \"typically between 60 and 100 BPM.\" This indicates that the answer is expected to be data-driven, factual, and measurable, rather than descriptive, narrative, or subjective. The answer does not require elaboration on the concept itself but directly provides the numerical value.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"normal,\" \"resting,\" \"heart rate,\" and \"healthy adult.\" \"Heart rate\" is a term that inherently refers to a measurable quantity, often expressed in numbers. \"Normal\" suggests a standard or typical value, which is numerical in nature. The phrase \"what is\" is a common interrogative that seeks information, but in this context, it is paired with a concept that is quantifiable. Comparing this to the category definitions: C04 \"numeric\" is indicated by words that imply measurement, quantity, or numerical data. Other categories do not fit as well: C01 \"entity\" might apply if the question was about the heart rate concept itself, but here it's about its value; C02 \"human\" is irrelevant as it doesn't focus on people; C03 \"description\" would require an explanation, but this is not the case; C05 \"location\" and C06 \"abbreviation\" are not applicable here.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the normal resting heart rate of a healthy adult?\" should be classified under C04 \"numeric\" because it directly requests a numerical value or range for a physiological measurement. Resting heart rate is a quantifiable attribute that can be expressed in numbers (e.g., beats per minute), and the question is designed to elicit a specific, measurable answer rather than a conceptual or descriptive one. For example, medical guidelines often state that a normal resting heart rate for adults is between 60 and 100 BPM, which is a numerical fact. This contrasts with other categories: C01 \"entity\" would apply to questions about the heart rate concept (e.g., \"what is resting heart rate?\"), but here the focus is on the value; C02 \"human\" would involve questions about individuals or human experiences, which is not the case; C03 \"description\" would require a detailed explanation, but this question seeks a straightforward number; C05 \"location\" and C06 \"abbreviation\" are unrelated as there is no spatial or acronym-related element. Therefore, the question aligns perfectly with C04 \"numeric\" due to its explicit request for a numerical quantity.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question unambiguously seeks a numerical value for a measurable quantity, fitting the definition of C04 \"numeric.\""

The core of the question is to identify the entity responsible for scaring people, which points to a query about a particular object, animal, or concept.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a noun or noun phrase that names the creature, such as \"shark\" or \"great white shark\". It should be a specific, concrete entity rather than a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, a location, or an abbreviation. The answer is expected to be concise and directly identify the thing in question, without requiring further elaboration or context.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"creature\", which directly refers to an entity (an animal or being). The phrase \"scares people in the film 'Jaws'\" provides context but does not change the core request for an entity. Other elements like \"film 'Jaws'\" are contextual and do not shift the category. There are no indicators of a human, description, numeric value, location, or abbreviation in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C01 - entity).**  \nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing that performs an action (scaring people). The word \"creature\" explicitly indicates a non-human entity, such as an animal or mythical being. In this case, the creature in \"Jaws\" is a shark, which is a concrete entity. This classification is appropriate because:  \n- It is not about a person (C02), as the question does not focus on individuals or human characteristics.  \n- It is not a description or definition request (C03), as the answer is expected to be a direct identification rather than an explanation.  \n- It is not asking for a number, date, or quantity (C04), as no numerical information is implied.  \n- It is not related to a location (C05), as the question is about an entity, not a place.  \n- It is not seeking an abbreviation's meaning (C06), as no acronym or short form is involved.  \nThe question's focus on identifying a specific thing aligns with the definition of C01, which encompasses queries about entities like animals, objects, or concepts.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly asks for a specific entity, and the category C01 is the most appropriate fit based on the analysis."

The information being sought is the name or identity of a particular human being—a woman golfer who achieved the milestone of earning a million dollars (or equivalent) in golf. This suggests the question is focused on a human subject rather than a general concept, object, or abstract idea.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a proper noun, such as a person's name, or a brief description of the individual. For example, the answer might be \"Dottie Pepper\" or another golfer's name, depending on the context. The response does not require a numerical value, a date, a definition, or a location-based description. Instead, it calls for human-centric information, such as biographical details or historical facts about a specific person.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"who,\" which is a strong indicator of a human-related query, and \"woman golfer,\" which specifies a person in a particular profession or role. The phrase \"first\" adds a contextual element of ranking or achievement, but it does not shift the focus away from the human subject. There is no mention of abbreviations, locations, or purely descriptive or numeric elements that would point to other categories like C03 (description), C04 (numeric), or C05 (location). The primary emphasis is on identifying a person.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it directly asks for information about a specific individual—a woman golfer—rather than a thing, concept, place, number, or acronym. The word \"who\" is a classic cue for human-related questions, as it seeks personal identity or biographical details. While the phrase \"earn a million\" might imply a numeric aspect (e.g., a monetary amount), the core of the question is not about the quantity itself but about the person who achieved that feat. This aligns with the C02 category, which encompasses questions about people, individuals, and human achievements. In contrast, categories like C04 would apply if the question asked for a date or amount (e.g., \"when did she earn a million?\"), or C03 if it sought an explanation (e.g., \"what does this achievement mean?\"). Here, the focus is squarely on identifying the human subject, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident in this classification as the question explicitly requests the identity of a specific person, which is a hallmark of the human category."

The core request is to name or describe the piece that holds the property of being the tallest, which involves recognizing a specific entity within the context of chess.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer would likely be the name of a chess piece (e.g., \"queen\" or \"king\"), as this is a direct identification question. The answer format is not numerical, descriptive, or location-based; it is focused on naming or specifying a particular object. The word \"tallest\" adds a comparative element, but the primary output is still the entity itself, not the measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words include \"tallest piece\" and \"on a chessboard.\" \"Piece\" refers to an object in a game, and \"tallest\" is an adjective describing a physical property. However, the question is not about a person (e.g., \"who\"), not asking for a definition or explanation (e.g., \"what is\"), not seeking a number or date (e.g., \"how many\"), not about a place (e.g., \"where\"), and not involving an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does X mean\"). These indicators point toward a question about a specific thing or object.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object or concept within a defined context (a chessboard). In chess, the pieces are distinct entities, such as pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings. The question seeks to identify which of these entities possesses the attribute of being the tallest, making it an inquiry into a particular thing rather than a person, description, number, location, or abbreviation.

This is inquiring about a specific item or thing (referred to as a \"product\") that was involved in an action performed by Robert Conrad. The core request is to identify the product, which implies the user is seeking a name or description of a particular object, concept, or thing. The question does not focus on the action itself (daring people) or the person (Robert Conrad) as the primary subject, but rather on the product that was central to the scenario.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a noun phrase or a specific name, such as a brand, item, or concept, that represents the product in question. For example, the answer might be something like \"a bottle of water\" or \"the Conrad Special\" if it's a reference to a stunt or product. The response should be concise and directly identify the entity, without requiring numerical data, explanations, or other categories. This suggests the answer is a specific thing, aligning with a categorical response rather than a descriptive or numeric one.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"product\", which directly refers to an object, item, or concept. Other phrases like \"dare people to knock off his shoulder\" provide context but do not change the core inquiry about the product. The word \"product\" is a strong indicator of an entity category, as it denotes a tangible or intangible thing. In contrast, words like \"robert conrad\" (which could point to a human) or \"dare\" (which might imply an action) are secondary elements that do not shift the primary focus to other categories like C02 (human) or C03 (description).\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is primarily asking for information about a specific object or thing—the product that Robert Conrad was associated with in the described action. The category description for C01 includes \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" and \"product\" fits this definition as it refers to a particular item or concept. While the question mentions \"robert conrad,\" which could be linked to a human, the main subject is the product, not the person or their actions. It is not a description question because it does not seek an explanation or definition; it asks for identification of a thing. It is not numeric, as no quantities or measurements are involved; not location, as no places are referenced; and not abbreviation, as no acronyms are being queried. Therefore, the focus on identifying a product makes C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly asks for a \"product,\" which is a clear example of an entity, and the reasoning aligns with the category definitions."

The request is for information that can be quantified or measured, such as a numerical value representing how fast the river flows. The focus is on obtaining a concrete piece of data rather than a general description or identification.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format for this question would typically involve a numerical value or a set of numerical values, often accompanied by units (e.g., miles per hour, kilometers per hour, or feet per second). For instance, a response might be \"The speed of the Mississippi River varies, but it is approximately 2 mph in some sections.\" The answer is expected to be quantitative, not qualitative, and may include statistics, measurements, or ranges. This contrasts with descriptive answers that would provide explanations or definitions without specific numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"speed,\" which is a term directly associated with a measurable quantity or physical property. \"Speed\" inherently implies a numerical value, as it requires units and a number to be meaningful. Additionally, \"mississippi river\" refers to a specific entity (a river), but the question is not about identifying or describing that entity; it is focused on a quantifiable aspect of it. The phrase \"what is\" is a common interrogative that seeks information, but in this context, it is paired with a word that specifies a need for a numerical response. There are no indicators of human elements, locations, descriptions, or abbreviations, which helps narrow down the category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the speed of the mississippi river ?\" should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a quantity that can be expressed in numerical terms. Speed is a physical measurement that is inherently numeric, requiring a value with appropriate units for accurate representation. For example, responses would involve numbers like \"approximately 1-3 mph\" or \"up to 5 mph in certain areas,\" which aligns with the definition of C04: questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n- To further justify this classification, consider the contrast with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity): This category involves questions about identifying or specifying objects or concepts, such as \"What is the Mississippi River?\" but not its properties. The current question is about a specific attribute, not the entity itself.\n  - C02 (human): This is irrelevant, as there is no mention or implication of people, individuals, or human-related information.\n  - C03 (description): This would apply to questions seeking detailed explanations or definitions, such as \"Describe the Mississippi River's ecosystem,\" but here, the focus is on a measurable quantity, not a narrative or explanatory response.\n  - C05 (location): This category deals with questions about places or geographical information, such as \"Where is the Mississippi River located?\" but the question is not about the river's location; it is about a characteristic of that location.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): There are no abbreviations or acronyms in the question, so this does not apply.\n- The core of the question is the request for a numerical value, which is a defining feature of C04. Even though the Mississippi River is an entity, the question is not asking about the entity but about a quantifiable property, making it numeric.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Based on the analysis, the question fits perfectly into the C04 category due to its direct request for a numerical measurement. I am highly confident in this classification, as it aligns with the category description and the nature of the query.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"how many sonnets did shakespeare write ?\". This is a query that seeks a specific numerical value, as it asks for the count of sonnets authored by Shakespeare. The core information requested is a quantity, which implies a number or a measurable count, rather than a description, definition, or other type of information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a numerical response, such as a specific number (e.g., \"154\" or \"approximately 154\"), possibly with some context or range if needed. It may include a date or historical reference if the number is tied to a particular era, but the primary characteristic is that the answer must be quantifiable. The response does not require a narrative, explanation, or detailed breakdown, as the focus is on providing a straightforward count.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" which is a direct interrogative phrase that signals a request for a quantity or numerical value. Additionally, \"sonnets\" refers to a specific literary form, and \"did shakespeare write\" indicates an action or fact related to a historical figure. However, the dominant element is the word \"how many,\" which is a strong indicator of a numeric question. Other relevant phrases include \"write,\" which implies a countable action, but the question is not seeking descriptive details about writing or sonnets themselves.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how many sonnets did shakespeare write ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity. The word \"how many\" is a clear cue for seeking a count or measurement, and in this context, it refers to the number of sonnets, which is a well-defined fact that can be expressed as a number (e.g., 154). While the question involves Shakespeare, who is a human, the focus is not on human-related information (like his life or achievements) but on a specific, quantifiable aspect of his work. This distinguishes it from C02 (human), as C02 would apply to questions about people themselves, such as \"who was William Shakespeare?\" or \"what did Shakespeare do?\" Here, the question is about a numerical output. It also differs from C03 (description), which would involve explanations or definitions (e.g., \"what are sonnets?\"), and from C01 (entity), which might ask about the nature of sonnets or other objects. There is no reference to location (C05) or abbreviation (C06), so the primary category is numeric due to the direct request for a number.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly employs the phrase \"how many,\" which is universally recognized as an indicator of a numeric query, and the answer is expected to be a specific count or quantity, aligning perfectly with the definition of C04."

    "cot": "\n### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what causes the redness in your cheeks when you blush?\" This is a query that seeks an explanation for a specific phenomenon. It is not asking for a simple fact, a definition, or a direct reference to an object or place. Instead, it is inquiring into the underlying reasons or mechanisms behind blushing, which involves a biological or physiological process. The key elements are the cause of redness, specifically in the context of blushing, indicating a request for detailed, explanatory information.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive and explanatory. It would likely involve a detailed explanation, such as a step-by-step description of the body's response, including factors like blood vessel dilation, emotional triggers, or hormonal changes. The answer is not expected to be a single number, date, or measurement (e.g., no specific quantity like \"5% increase\"), nor is it focused on a location or spatial aspect. Instead, it requires a narrative or definitional response that provides clarity and depth, aligning with the need for a comprehensive understanding of the topic.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"causes,\" \"redness,\" \"cheeks,\" and \"blush.\" The word \"causes\" explicitly signals a request for an explanation or reason, which is central to the description category. \"Redness in your cheeks\" describes a physical state, and \"when you blush\" refers to a common human experience. These elements suggest that the question is not about identifying a specific entity (like a blush itself) or a person, but rather about providing detailed information on how or why something happens. This use of language points toward seeking an explanation, which is characteristic of C03.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what causes the redness in your cheeks when you blush?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation of a phenomenon. The core of the query is to understand the reasons behind blushing, which involves detailing the physiological processes, such as increased blood flow due to adrenaline or social embarrassment. This falls under the description category as defined by the category descriptions: questions that seek explanations, definitions, or detailed information. Unlike C01 (entity), which would focus on a specific thing or concept (e.g., \"what is blushing?\"), this question delves into the cause, requiring a broader, explanatory response. It is not a human-related question (C02) because it is not about individuals or personal experiences but about the general mechanism. It is not numeric (C04) since no quantities or measurements are requested, nor is it location-based (C05) or abbreviation-focused (C06). The descriptive nature of the expected answer—such as explaining the role of capillaries or emotions—clearly aligns with C03.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests an explanation for a phenomenon, which matches the definition of the description category."

The word \"define\" explicitly requests an explanation, definition, or detailed description of the subject. The subject is \"the pheonix club\", which appears to refer to a specific entity, such as a club, organization, or concept. The request is not for a simple fact retrieval but for a comprehensive breakdown of what this entity is, its characteristics, or its meaning. This indicates that the question is seeking interpretive or explanatory information rather than a straightforward identification or numerical data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a descriptive, textual response that provides an explanation, definition, or detailed account. For example, the answer might include historical context, purpose, or other attributes of the Phoenix Club. This format is not numerical, as there are no requests for quantities or dates; it is not location-based, as no spatial information is implied; and it is not abbreviated, as the question does not ask for the expansion of an acronym. The answer should be explanatory in nature, focusing on clarity and detail, which aligns with categories that involve elaboration.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"define\", which is a direct indicator of a request for a definition or explanation. This word is central to the C03 category description. Additionally, \"the pheonix club\" refers to a specific noun phrase, but the modifier \"define\" shifts the focus from mere identification to detailed description. Other categories can be ruled out: there are no words suggesting a human element (C02), no numerical or measurement-related terms (C04), no geographical focus (C05), and no abbreviations (C06). The presence of \"define\" strongly points to C03, as it implies a need for expanded information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"define the pheonix club ?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition, which is a core characteristic of this category. The word \"define\" directly invokes the need for detailed information, such as a definition, explanation, or breakdown of the subject. While \"the pheonix club\" could be interpreted as an entity (C01), the request for a definition elevates it to a description category, as C03 covers questions that seek more than just identification—they require elaboration, context, or clarification. For instance, if the question was simply \"What is the Phoenix Club?\", it might lean toward C01, but the word \"define\" specifies a deeper inquiry. No other category fits, as the question does not involve numbers, locations, people, or abbreviations. This classification ensures that the response addresses the user's intent for a comprehensive explanation.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the word \"define\" is a clear signal for a descriptive query, and the category C03 encompasses questions that demand detailed, explanatory answers, which aligns perfectly with the question's intent."

It is inquiring into the nature or identity of these devices, which are likely specific types of games or machines. The information requested is the identification of what these terms refer to, such as the actual devices or concepts behind the nicknames.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format would involve naming or describing the gaming devices themselves. For instance, the response might list the official names of the devices (e.g., \"Mississippi Marbles\" could refer to a specific slot machine variant, and \"Memphis Dominoes\" to another game). The answer is expected to be a direct reference to existing entities, not a numerical value, location, or abstract explanation. The characteristics include specificity and the need to identify concrete objects or concepts.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"gaming devices\", \"dubbed 'Mississippi Marbles'\", and \"dubbed 'Memphis Dominoes'\". The word \"gaming devices\" directly points to objects or things in the context of games. The term \"dubbed\" suggests that \"Mississippi Marbles\" and \"Memphis Dominoes\" are alternative names or nicknames for specific entities, indicating a query about what these terms denote. These elements align with the \"entity\" category, as they seek to identify particular things rather than people, places, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for the identification of specific objects or concepts—the gaming devices themselves. The core of the query is to determine what \"Mississippi Marbles\" and \"Memphis Dominoes\" refer to, which involves recognizing them as named entities in the gaming world. This is not a question about human-related information (C02), as no individuals are mentioned; it is not seeking a detailed explanation or definition (C03), as it does not ask for an account of what the devices are or how they work; it is not focused on numbers or quantities (C04), as no numerical data is implied; it is not about geographical locations (C05), as the query is not spatial; and it is not about abbreviations (C06), as the terms are full phrases, not shortened forms. The question directly seeks the entities (things) that these nicknames represent, making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly asks for the identification of specific gaming devices, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an \"entity\" category."

The information being requested is not a simple fact, like a definition or a location, but rather an evaluation or explanation of its success. This involves assessing factors such as its benefits, drawbacks, empirical evidence, or overall impact, which suggests a need for a descriptive or interpretive response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be descriptive, explanatory, or narrative in nature. It may include details such as historical context, scientific studies, user experiences, or comparisons to other treatments, rather than a concise list or a single number. Characteristics of the response could involve subjective or objective analysis, potentially drawing from research or anecdotes, but it is not expected to be purely numerical or factual without elaboration. This contrasts with categories like numeric (which requires specific numbers) or entity (which might focus on basic facts), indicating that the answer will be more comprehensive and explanatory.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how successful,\" which is a common indicator of a descriptive inquiry. This phrase implies a request for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the concept's performance or qualities. Other elements, such as \"is aromatherapy,\" refer to a specific entity, but the core of the question is about its success, not its basic identity. These keywords align with the description category (C03), as they suggest the need for elaboration rather than a straightforward fact or number.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"how successful is aromatherapy?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is seeking an explanation or detailed information about the success of a specific concept. Aromatherapy is an entity itself (potentially fitting C01), but the question is not asking for its definition or basic characteristics; instead, it delves into its effectiveness, which requires a descriptive response. This involves providing reasons, evidence, or contextual details, such as discussing studies on its efficacy, potential benefits, limitations, or comparisons to other therapies. The use of \"how successful\" indicates an evaluative and explanatory demand, which is characteristic of the description category. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not focused on what aromatherapy is; it's about its performance. It also doesn't align with C04 (numeric) because it's not asking for a specific number or measurement, nor C05 (location) or C06 (abbreviation), as no spatial or acronym-related elements are present. Thus, the question naturally falls under C03 for its need for detailed, explanatory information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a descriptive explanation of aromatherapy's success, which matches the C03 category. I am highly confident in this classification, as the question's phrasing and intent directly align with the description category's focus on explanations and detailed information.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The core request is to identify the person who uttered the quote \"we'll win I guarantee it.\" The question type is focused on attribution, seeking information about an individual's identity or role in an event. This indicates that the information being requested is related to a human being, as it asks for who said something, implying a specific person or people involved.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a name or a brief description of a person, such as a football player, coach, or other individual associated with the event. For example, in historical context, this quote is famously attributed to Joe Namath, the quarterback for the New York Jets. The answer should be concise and directly identify the human source, rather than providing a definition, date, location, or other non-human-related details. The characteristics of the expected answer include specificity to a person, with no need for numerical data, spatial details, or explanatory text beyond the attribution.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases from the question include \"who said,\" which is a direct indicator of a human-related inquiry, as it seeks to identify an individual. Other relevant elements are \"Super Bowl III in 1969,\" which provides contextual background but does not shift the focus away from the human aspect; it simply frames the question within a human event (a sports game involving people). There are no words suggesting other categories, such as \"what\" for entities, \"when\" for numeric/dates, \"where\" for locations, or \"what does\" for descriptions. The quote itself is a human utterance, reinforcing the need to identify the speaker.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly asks for information about a person or individual. The phrase \"who said\" is a clear signal that the query is seeking human attribution, such as a name or role, rather than details about an object, concept, number, place, or abbreviation. In this case, the context of Super Bowl III in 1969 involves human participants (e.g., players, coaches), and the quote is a human-generated statement. While the question mentions a specific event and year, these elements are secondary and do not change the primary focus on identifying a person. For instance, historical knowledge confirms that this quote is from Joe Namath, a human individual, making the question fundamentally about human-related information. This aligns with the C02 category description, which encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human actions, as opposed to other categories like C01 (entity) for non-human things or C03 (description) for explanations.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly centers on identifying a human source, with no ambiguity in its request for personal attribution, and it matches the C02 category's focus on people and human-related inquiries."

The phrase \"what is\" indicates an inquiry for information, and the focus is on \"dudley do right ' s horse ' s name\", which refers to the name of a particular entity (the horse). The question is not asking for a general explanation, a numerical value, or a location; it is directly requesting a specific piece of information about a thing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Bob\" (if referring to the horse from the character Dudley Do Right).

The question is straightforward and aims to retrieve a specific piece of information about an object, making C01 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question clearly seeks a specific identifier for a named entity, aligning perfectly with the definition of C01."

    "cot": "\n### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"where does chocolate come from?\" is inquiring about the origin or source of chocolate. It uses the word \"where,\" which indicates a request for spatial or geographical information. Specifically, the question seeks to know the locations or regions from which chocolate originates, such as countries, continents, or specific areas where cacao beans are grown and processed. This suggests that the information being requested is about places or spatial origins, rather than abstract concepts, people, definitions, numbers, or acronyms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a descriptive response that includes geographical locations, such as \"Chocolate comes from places like South America, Africa, and parts of Asia,\" or more specifically, \"It originates from the Amazon basin in South America and West Africa.\" The answer format is not numerical (e.g., it's not asking for a count or date), not a simple definition (e.g., it's not defining what chocolate is), and not focused on a single entity or person. Instead, it involves providing spatial details, which could include names of regions, countries, or even coordinates in some cases. The answer is expected to be informative and location-based, often drawing from geographical knowledge.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"where\" and \"come from.\" \"Where\" is a direct indicator of a location-based inquiry, as it asks for a place or position. \"Come from\" implies origin or source, which is inherently spatial and geographical. Other phrases like \"does chocolate\" refer to the subject matter but do not change the core request for location information. There are no words suggesting a human element (e.g., \"who\"), a numerical value (e.g., \"how many\"), a definition (e.g., \"what is\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does X mean\"). These elements help confirm that the question is not falling into other categories like C02 (human) or C04 (numeric).\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where does chocolate come from?\" should be classified under category C05 (location) because it directly asks for geographical or spatial information. The word \"where\" explicitly seeks out places, and \"come from\" reinforces the need for origin-based locations. Chocolate's origin is tied to specific regions like the Andes mountains in South America, the Ivory Coast in Africa, and other tropical areas where cacao trees are cultivated. This makes the question fundamentally about identifying locations, which aligns with the definition of C05: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about a specific thing like \"cacao beans\" alone; it's about their origin. It also doesn't fit C02 (human) as it's not about people or human activities directly, though humans are involved in the process, the focus is on the location. Similarly, it doesn't involve C03 (description) because it's not seeking an explanation or definition, nor C04 (numeric) because it's not asking for quantities or dates, and not C06 (abbreviation) because there's no mention of an acronym or initialism. Therefore, the question is clearly location-focused.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question \"where does chocolate come from?\" is unambiguously asking for geographical locations, making it a prime example of category C05. I am highly confident in this classification, as the key elements of the question—specifically the use of \"where\" and the concept of origin—directly map to the category's focus on spatial information.\n\nFinal classification: C05"

The focus is on finding a resource or venue for the case.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a noun phrase or a descriptive location, such as a court name, legal database (e.g., Westlaw or LexisNexis), government website (e.g., U.S. Department of Education), or a specific repository. It may involve physical or digital spaces, and the answer could include details like URLs, addresses, or names of institutions. This format is characteristic of a location-based response, not a numerical value, definition, or other category-specific output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases include \"where,\" \"find,\" and \"case.\" The word \"where\" is a strong indicator of a location-based question, as it directly asks for a place or position. \"Find\" implies a search or retrieval action, often tied to a specific location. The phrase \"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1991\" refers to a specific entity (an act), but the question is not inquiring about its definition, details, or properties; instead, it's focused on where to locate information or a case related to it. This shifts the emphasis to the locational aspect.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C05 (\"location\") because it is explicitly asking for a place or location to find a case. The core of the query is spatial or positional: \"where can I find\" prompts an answer that specifies a venue, such as a legal database, court system, or online resource. While the question mentions a specific act, which could be classified under C01 (entity) if the focus was on the act itself, here the primary intent is to locate something (a case) rather than to describe or define it. This aligns with the C05 category, which encompasses questions about places, geographical or digital locations, and spatial information. Other categories do not fit:\n- C01 (entity) is for questions about objects or concepts, but this question is not seeking information about the act; it's about finding a case related to it.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no mention of people.\n- C03 (description) would involve explaining or defining the act, which is not the case here.\n- C04 (numeric) would require a number, date, or quantity, such as the year or a statistic, but the question is not asking for that.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is not applicable, as no abbreviation is involved.\n\nThe use of \"where\" is a clear linguistic cue for a location-based question, and the context of \"finding a case\" reinforces that the answer will be locational rather than descriptive or numerical.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct because the question's structure and key words (\"where,\" \"find\") directly point to a locational inquiry, and the context of seeking a case related to a specific act fits the C05 category perfectly."

The word \"who\" directly indicates a focus on people, and the context involves an event (receiving an award) in a particular year. The question is not asking for general information about the award or its history, but rather for the identity of the recipient, which points to a human-related inquiry.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a name, such as a person's full name or a list of names, based on the phrasing. For example, the response might be something like \"Tommy Lee Jones\" or a similar individual's name. This format suggests that the answer is not a numerical value, a date, a definition, or a location, but rather a reference to a human being.

The phrase \"Will Rogers Award\" refers to a specific entity (an award), but the question is not inquiring about the award itself (e.g., its origin or criteria), but rather about the human recipient. The year \"1989\" is a temporal detail that adds specificity but does not shift the category. These elements collectively highlight a focus on human-related information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under category C02 (human) because it primarily asks about people, individuals, or human-related information. The word \"who\" is a strong indicator that the query is seeking a human subject, and the context of \"receiving an award\" involves human actions and achievements. While \"Will Rogers Award\" is an entity (which might suggest C01), the question is not centered on the entity but on the human recipient. This aligns with the C02 category, which encompasses questions about individuals, such as biographical details or specific events involving people.

The key phrase \"what is the function of\" indicates that the user is asking for detailed information about how something operates or what its intended use is. Specifically, RAM is a technical term referring to a type of computer hardware, and the question is focused on its functional aspect, such as memory management or data processing in computing systems.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would be descriptive, likely consisting of a detailed explanation, definition, or step-by-step description. For instance, a typical response might explain that RAM is used for temporary data storage, enabling faster access to information compared to other storage methods. The answer would not be a simple factoid, a number, or a list; it would require elaboration to convey the concept clearly. This contrasts with categories like numeric (which expects numerical data) or abbreviation (which expects the expansion of an acronym), as the focus here is on providing a comprehensive understanding of the function.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"what is the function of,\" which is a common indicator for descriptive questions. \"Function\" specifically implies a request for an explanation or definition, as it asks about the purpose or operational details of RAM. Other elements, such as \"ram\" (an acronym for Random Access Memory), do not shift the focus to an abbreviation category, as the question is not inquiring about its meaning but rather its function. The absence of words like \"who,\" \"where,\" \"how many,\" or \"what does it stand for\" further supports that this is not a human, location, numeric, or abbreviation question.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the function of ram ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it directly asks for an explanation or definition of RAM's role. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek detailed information, such as explanations, definitions, or breakdowns of concepts. In this case, the user is not merely identifying RAM as an entity (C01) or asking for its basic definition (which might still fall under description), but specifically inquiring about its function, which requires a descriptive response. For example, an answer might cover how RAM facilitates quick data access in computers, making it a core component of memory management.

The information being requested is the word or phrase that defines the fear of cockroaches, which is a psychological or common term for a specific phobia. The question focuses on identifying a named entity rather than providing an explanation, number, location, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a single word or short phrase, such as a noun or term from psychology or everyday language (e.g., \"kotosho\" or \"cochliaspobia\"). This suggests the answer is categorical and refers to a specific concept, not a numerical value, a detailed explanation, a location, or an expanded form of an acronym. The answer is expected to be direct and concise, indicating a factual retrieval rather than descriptive or analytical content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"fear,\" \"called,\" and \"cockroaches.\" \"Fear\" refers to an emotion or concept, \"called\" is a common interrogative phrase used to ask for the name or designation of something, and \"cockroaches\" specifies the object of the fear. These words point to a question that is inquiring about a specific term or entity, rather than seeking an explanation, quantity, place, or abbreviation. The phrase \"what is ... called\" is a classic indicator of a question about naming or identifying a concept.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object, concept, or thing. In this case, the \"fear of cockroaches\" is a particular entity—a psychological concept or phobia related to the insect cockroach. The question is not focused on people (C02), as it does not reference individuals or human experiences; it is about a generalized concept. It is also not a description (C03), as it does not request an explanation or definition but simply the name of the entity. There is no numerical element (C04), no spatial or geographical reference (C05), and no mention of abbreviations or acronyms (C06). The core of the question is to identify and retrieve the term for this specific fear, which aligns with the definition of an entity—a distinct, named thing or concept. This classification is appropriate because entities can include abstract concepts like phobias, which are treated as specific items in knowledge bases.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly seeks the name of a specific concept (the fear of cockroaches), which is a clear example of an entity under the C01 category, and there are no indicators suggesting any other category."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"what is the use of a 24 hour clock instead of a 12 hour clock?\"\n\nThis question is inquiring about the purpose, benefits, or reasons for preferring a 24-hour clock format over a 12-hour clock format. It is not simply asking for a definition or identification of the clocks themselves, but rather seeking an explanation of their application, advantages, and practical uses in various contexts. The core request is for descriptive information that elaborates on how and why one system might be better suited for certain purposes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be detailed, explanatory, and narrative in nature. It may include comparisons, examples, and reasoning to clarify the concept. For instance, the answer might discuss how a 24-hour clock reduces ambiguity in time representation, is commonly used in international settings, or avoids confusion with AM/PM designations. The response is not expected to be a simple list, a number, or a concise definition, but rather a comprehensive explanation that provides depth and context. This aligns with categories that involve elaboration and detail, rather than factual identification or numerical data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"use\": This word directly indicates a request for explanation or justification, such as why something is employed or its benefits.\n- \"instead of\": This phrase suggests a comparison or contrast, implying that the answer should highlight differences and the rationale for preferring one option over another.\n- \"24 hour clock\" and \"12 hour clock\": These are specific concepts or objects, but the question is not focused on identifying them (which would be an entity category) or defining them (which might lean toward description but is secondary here). Instead, the emphasis is on their functional use.\n\nThese elements point toward a descriptive category because they involve seeking detailed information about how these clocks are applied, rather than just stating what they are or where they are located.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the concept of using a 24-hour clock versus a 12-hour clock. Specifically:\n- The word \"use\" indicates a need for descriptive content that explains the purpose, advantages, and practical applications of the 24-hour clock system. This involves providing reasons, such as avoiding time confusion, facilitating global communication, or being standard in certain industries like transportation and military.\n- The phrase \"instead of\" implies a comparative analysis, which requires detailed information to contrast the two systems, including their historical development, common uses, and benefits. For example, the answer might describe how a 24-hour clock eliminates the need for AM/PM, making it clearer in digital displays or schedules.\n- This contrasts with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity): The question is not primarily about identifying or defining the clocks themselves (e.g., \"What is a 24-hour clock?\"), but rather about their function and application.\n  - C02 (human): There is no mention of people, individuals, or human-related aspects, so this category does not apply.\n  - C04 (numeric): While the question might involve numbers (e.g., hours in a day), it is not the focus; the primary request is for descriptive text, not numerical data.\n  - C05 (location): No geographical or spatial elements are involved, as the question is about time formats, not places.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): No abbreviations or acronyms are referenced or implied in the question.\n\nThe overall nature of the question is explanatory and detailed, fitting the \"description\" category, which encompasses questions that seek explanations, definitions, or in-depth information about concepts, processes, or comparisons.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question explicitly requests a descriptive explanation rather than a factual, numerical, or categorical response."

The core request is to identify the name or identity of that president, which implies a factual inquiry into a historical or personal fact related to a person. The question does not ask for a general explanation, a numerical value, a location, or an abbreviation; instead, it focuses on pinpointing a specific human figure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a proper noun, such as a full name or a commonly recognized identifier of a U.S. president (e.g., \"John F. Kennedy\" or \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\"). The answer should be concise and directly refer to the individual in question, without requiring additional details like dates, measurements, or definitions. This suggests a response that is categorical and identification-based, rather than descriptive or quantitative. The characteristics of the expected answer include being a singular entity (one president) and potentially involving a narrative or contextual element (e.g., the dream itself), but the primary focus is on the person.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include:  \n- \"United States president\": This directly refers to a human role, specifically a person holding a high-ranking political office.  \n- \"had dreamed\": This verb phrase indicates an action or event tied to a person, emphasizing a personal or historical experience.  \n- \"he was assassinated\": The pronoun \"he\" specifies the subject as male, and \"assassinated\" refers to a dramatic event, but it is framed as a dream, which is still tied to the individual.  \n- Overall, the question centers on identifying a specific person (the president) and an event associated with them, which aligns with queries about human-related information. These keywords highlight a focus on a living or historical individual rather than an object, concept, place, or acronym.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under category C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking about a specific person, the U.S. president, and an event in their life. The category C02 is defined as \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information,\" which encompasses inquiries that seek to identify, describe, or contextualize human experiences. In this case, the question is not about a general concept (C01), a definition (C03), a number (C04), a place (C05), or an acronym (C06). Instead, it requires knowledge of a particular individual's biography or historical fact. For example, the answer might involve a president like John F. Kennedy, who is famously associated with dreaming of his own assassination, making this a query about a human subject. The use of \"president\" and \"he\" reinforces the focus on a human entity, and the expected answer format (a name or identifier) further supports this classification. This contrasts with other categories, such as C01 (entity), which could include non-human entities, or C03 (description), which would involve explaining something rather than identifying a person.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly references a specific human role (U.S. president) and seeks to identify an individual based on a personal event, which aligns perfectly with the definition of C02."

The core information being requested is the title of the film, which is a particular entity in the context of cinema. The question focuses on identifying a specific object or thing (the film) rather than a person, description, number, location, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely a specific film title, such as \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" or a similar name, which is a noun phrase representing a concrete or abstract entity. The answer format is typically a proper noun or a named concept, not a numerical value, date, descriptive text, or location. It is concise and direct, as it seeks a single piece of information (the film title) rather than an explanation or multiple details.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"film,\" \"lee marvin,\" \"1965,\" and \"best actor oscar.\" \"Film\" directly indicates an entity, as it refers to a specific thing (a movie). \"Lee Marvin\" is a human, but the question is not centered on him; it is using him as a context to ask about the film. \"1965\" and \"best actor oscar\" provide contextual details (year and award), but they do not change the primary focus on the entity being sought. Phrases like \"win the 1965 best actor oscar for\" emphasize the award, but the question is fundamentally asking for the associated film, which is an entity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question belongs to category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or concept—the film that Lee Marvin won the Best Actor Oscar for in 1965. An entity in this classification refers to any distinct thing, such as a physical object, concept, or creation, and a film fits this definition as it is a tangible cultural artifact or work of art. While the question mentions \"lee marvin,\" who is a human, the primary focus is not on the person but on the film, making it ineligible for C02 (human). It is not a description (C03), as it does not seek an explanation or definition; it asks for a direct reference. There is no request for a number, date, quantity, or measurement (C04), nor is it about a place or spatial information (C05). Finally, there is no abbreviation or acronym involved (C06). The key word \"film\" and the context of the Oscar win clearly point to an entity, as the answer will be a specific film title, which is a named entity in the domain of entertainment.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly seeks a specific film, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an entity, and the reasoning process logically supports this categorization based on the question's structure and key elements."

The key element is the word \"where,\" which indicates a request for spatial or directional information. The subject, \"Basque Country,\" refers to a specific region or area, likely involving countries, continents, or other geographical entities. The information being requested is not about the nature or identity of the Basque Country itself, but rather its exact or approximate location on a map or in terms of boundaries.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would typically be a description of a place, such as a country, continent, or coordinates. For example, a response might include: \"Basque Country is located in the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain and extends into the French department of Pyrénées-Atlantiques.\" This answer format involves providing spatial details, which could include names of regions, countries, or other locational descriptors. It does not require a numerical value, a definition, or a list of people, nor does it involve abbreviations. The answer is inherently descriptive in terms of geography but is focused on location rather than general explanation.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe question contains several key indicators that point to the C05 category (location). The word \"where\" is a strong signal for location-based inquiries, as it directly asks for spatial information. Additionally, the phrase \"located\" reinforces the request for a place or position. The subject \"Basque Country\" is a proper noun referring to a specific geographical area, which is a common target for location questions. Comparing with other categories, there are no words suggesting a focus on entities (like \"what is\"), humans (like \"who\"), descriptions (like \"what is it\"), numbers (like \"how many\"), or abbreviations (like \"what does it mean\"). These key phrases and words are consistent with the definition of C05.\n\n#### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where is basque country located?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for geographical or spatial information. The core of the query is to pinpoint the position of Basque Country, which involves identifying its boundaries, neighboring regions, or countries. This aligns perfectly with the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" \n\n- **Reasoning for C05**: The use of \"where\" and \"located\" directly invokes the concept of location, making it distinct from other categories. For instance:\n  - C01 (entity) might apply if the question was about what Basque Country is (e.g., \"What is Basque Country?\"), but here the focus is on its placement.\n  - C02 (human) would be relevant if the question involved people or individuals, such as \"Who are the Basques?\" but it does not.\n  - C03 (description) could fit if the question asked for a detailed explanation or definition, like \"Describe Basque Country,\" but this question is specifically about its location.\n  - C04 (numeric) would be appropriate for questions involving numbers, such as \"How many people live in Basque Country?\" but no quantities are requested here.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as \"Basque Country\" is not an abbreviation and the question does not seek its meaning.\n\nIn contrast, C05 encompasses questions that deal with physical or conceptual places, ensuring that the response provides locational data. The Basque Country is a well-known region, and the question's intent is clearly to find its whereabouts, which is a classic example of a location query.\n\n#### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and key words unambiguously point to the location category based on the provided definitions and analysis."

This phrasing indicates a request for information about the nature, characteristics, or definition of \"dry ice\". It is not simply asking for identification or a fact retrieval but rather an explanation or detailed account. The subject \"dry ice\" refers to a specific scientific or everyday concept, and the question seeks to understand what it is, which involves providing a description rather than just a name or category.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a definition, explanation, or detailed explanation of dry ice. For instance, it might include information about its composition (e.g., it's solid carbon dioxide), properties (e.g., it sublimes at room temperature), uses (e.g., in cooling or special effects), or other relevant details. The answer format is not numerical, locational, or abbreviated; it is textual and explanatory, focusing on providing a comprehensive understanding of the concept. This aligns with questions that require elaboration rather than simple facts or numbers.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a classic indicator of a descriptive query, often used to seek definitions, explanations, or detailed information. The term \"dry ice\" itself is a noun referring to a specific entity, but the question is not asking for its classification as an object (which might lean toward C01) or for its properties in a numerical sense (C04). There are no words suggesting a location (C05), a person (C02), or an abbreviation (C06). The phrase \"what is\" directly points to the need for a descriptive answer, reinforcing the C03 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"what is dry ice ?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition of a concept. Dry ice is a specific entity—a form of carbon dioxide that exists as a solid—but the question is not focused on identifying it as an object or retrieving basic facts. Instead, it seeks detailed information, such as its chemical makeup, behavior, and applications, which falls under the description category. \n\nTo contrast with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply if the question was simply asking \"What is dry ice?\" in a way that seeks identification (e.g., \"dry ice is a type of ice\"), but here the \"what is\" implies a deeper explanatory need.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no reference to people or human elements.\n- C04 (numeric) does not fit, as the question does not ask for a number, date, or quantity (e.g., \"how cold is dry ice?\" would be numeric).\n- C05 (location) is not applicable, as dry ice is not a place or spatial concept.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is incorrect, as dry ice is not an acronym or initialism; it's a common term.\n\nThe core of the question is to provide a descriptive account, making C03 the most appropriate category. This classification ensures that the response addresses the need for detailed information rather than a simple categorization or numerical data.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and intent clearly align with the C03 category for descriptive queries.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

It is not inquiring about a general concept, a person, a numerical value, a location, or an abbreviation.\n- The question type is focused on retrieving a concrete answer about an object or thing, which suggests it is not descriptive, numeric, locational, or human-oriented.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\n- The expected answer format is likely to be a specific name or description of the card, such as \"the deuce of clubs\" or \"the right bower,\" depending on the rules of euchre. This is because the question is asking for the \"most powerful card,\" implying a direct reference to a particular entity (the card itself).\n- Characteristics of the expected answer include being a noun phrase or a short description that identifies a tangible or conceptual object. It does not require a numerical value, an explanation, a date, a geographical location, or the expansion of an acronym. The answer is expected to be factual and concise, pointing to a specific item within the domain of card games.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"most powerful card\" and \"in euchre.\"\n- \"Card\" is a clear indicator of an object or thing, as it refers to a physical or conceptual entity used in games.\n- \"Most powerful\" suggests a comparative aspect, but it still points to the identification of a specific entity rather than a description or quantity.\n- \"In euchre\" provides context, specifying the domain (a card game), but it does not change the core request for a specific thing. There are no words indicating a person (e.g., \"who\" or \"whom\"), a number (e.g., \"how many\" or \"what date\"), a location (e.g., \"where\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does X mean\").\n- These keywords align with the \"entity\" category, as they focus on asking about a particular object or concept.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\n- The question \"what 's the most powerful card in euchre ?\" should be classified under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for information about a specific object or thing—the most powerful card in the game of euchre.\n- Category C01 is defined as questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things. In this case, the card is a tangible or conceptual entity within the context of euchre, which is a card game. The question seeks to identify this entity, rather than to explain it (which would be C03), quantify it (C04), locate it (C05), or refer to a person or abbreviation (C02 or C06).\n- To break it down further:\n  - The phrase \"most powerful card\" directly references a specific thing (a card) that has a defined role or property in euchre. This is not a general inquiry about card games but a targeted question for a particular instance.\n  - Euchre itself is a concept, but the question is not asking about the game as a whole; it is focused on a component of the game—a card. This component is an entity.\n  - The expected answer format reinforces this, as it would be a name or type of card, not a narrative or numerical data. For example, in euchre, the most powerful card is often the \"right bower\" (which is the jack of the same color as the dealer's left bower), so the answer is a specific entity.\n  - Comparing to other categories:\n    - C02 (human) is irrelevant because no people are mentioned or implied.\n    - C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, but this question is not asking \"what is euchre?\" or \"describe a card\"; it is asking for a specific identification.\n    - C04 (numeric) would involve numbers, such as \"what is the point value of the most powerful card?\" but here, the focus is on the card itself, not its numerical attributes.\n    - C05 (location) is not applicable, as no spatial or geographical elements are involved.\n    - C06 (abbreviation) is not relevant, as there is no acronym or short form being queried.\n  - Therefore, the question fits C01 because it centers on identifying a specific object (the card) in a defined context, which is the essence of an \"entity\" question.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\n- Based on the analysis, the question is correctly classified under C01. I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly asks for a specific object (the card) and aligns with the definition of C01, while clearly differentiating from other categories based on the keywords and expected answer format.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The core of the question is asking for the meaning of a specific term. This suggests the user is seeking an explanation, definition, or detailed description of \"intractable plantar keratoma,\" which appears to be a medical or scientific concept. The question type is not focused on identifying a single fact, like a date or location, but rather on providing a comprehensive understanding of the term.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format involves providing an explanation, definition, or detailed breakdown of the term \"intractable plantar keratoma.\" This could include breaking down the word components (e.g., \"intractable\" meaning stubborn or resistant, \"plantar\" relating to the sole of the foot, and \"keratoma\" a growth of keratin), contextual information about its medical significance, or a full description of what it represents. The answer is likely to be descriptive, narrative, or explanatory in nature, rather than a simple numerical value, a list of entities, or a direct reference to a person or place.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what does ... mean?\" which is a classic indicator of a descriptive query. This phrase explicitly requests an explanation or definition, rather than just identification. Additionally, the term \"intractable plantar keratoma\" is a specific concept, but the question is not asking for its existence or classification as an entity; it's focused on its meaning. Other potential clues include the use of backticks, which might denote a technical or specialized term, but this does not change the core intent of seeking a description. Comparing to category keywords:\n- \"Entity\" might be suggested by the specificity of the term, but the question is not asking \"What is it?\" in a factual sense; it's asking for its meaning.\n- \"Description\" is directly implied by \"what does ... mean?\" which seeks elaboration.\n- No other categories fit, as there are no numerical, locational, or abbreviatory elements in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition of a specific term. The phrase \"what does ... mean?\" is a standard linguistic marker for descriptive queries, where the goal is to provide detailed information, context, or interpretation rather than to identify a single fact or object. In this case, \"intractable plantar keratoma\" is likely a medical term, and the question is requesting a breakdown or description of its nature, which aligns with the C03 category's focus on explanations and definitions. While the term could be considered an entity (C01), the question's intent is not to classify or identify it but to describe it, making C03 the more appropriate fit. This classification ensures that the response addresses the need for detailed information, which is distinct from categories like C04 (numeric) or C06 (abbreviation), where the focus would be on numbers or acronym meanings.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and wording (\"what does ... mean?\") are clear indicators of a descriptive query, and the term provided fits within the scope of seeking detailed information."

This is an inquiry about the duration of time associated with the creation of the novel \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce. The core information being requested is a specific numerical value representing the number of years it took to complete the work. The question focuses on quantifying the time span, rather than seeking descriptive, explanatory, or categorical information.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is a numerical response, such as an integer or a decimal number, possibly accompanied by units like \"years\". For example, a typical answer might be \"approximately 2 years\" or \"exactly 12 years\", depending on the source. The answer should be concise and quantifiable, not involving subjective opinions, detailed narratives, or non-numeric data. This indicates that the question is seeking a measurable quantity, which aligns with categories that deal with numbers or measurements.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many years\", which explicitly signals a request for a quantity or count. The word \"years\" is a unit of measurement, reinforcing the need for a numerical answer. Additionally, the phrase \"did it take\" implies a temporal duration, often expressed in numbers. While the question mentions \"james joyce\" (a human) and \"ulysses\" (an entity), these elements do not change the primary intent; the focus is on the numeric aspect of the duration. There are no words suggesting description, location, abbreviation, or other categories, such as \"what is\" (for description) or \"where\" (for location).\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a numerical value—the number of years it took to write \"Ulysses\". The category C04 encompasses questions that seek numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements, as defined in the provided descriptions. In this case, the question is not inquiring about an entity (C01), a human in a general sense (C02), a detailed explanation or definition (C03), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is focused on retrieving a specific fact that can be quantified, such as historical data on the writing process. For instance, historical records indicate that James Joyce took approximately 12 years to write \"Ulysses\", from 1904 to 1922, which is a numeric fact. Even though the question involves a human subject and a literary work, the central request is for a number, making C04 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and key phrases unambiguously point to a numeric query.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

This appears to be a query seeking a numerical count, specifically asking for the number of types of dog tails. The core intent is to determine a quantity or measurement, as indicated by the phrase \"how many\". The subject matter involves counting categories (types) of a specific attribute (dogs' tails), which suggests the question is requesting a numerical answer rather than a descriptive or categorical one.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is a numerical value, such as an integer or a specific number, because the question starts with \"how many\". Characteristics of this format include precision and quantifiability; the answer should be a count or measurement that can be expressed as a number. For instance, a response like \"There are approximately 10 types\" or \"Three types\" would fit, but the question does not require additional explanation or context beyond the numerical value itself. The presence of \"three\" at the end might be a fragment or error, but it does not alter the primary request for a quantity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many\", which is a strong indicator of a numeric question, as it directly prompts for a count or measurement. Additionally, \"types\" suggests a categorical count, and \"dogs ' tails\" provides context but does not change the numeric focus. Other potential categories can be ruled out: \"entity\" would require identifying specific things, \"human\" involves people, \"description\" asks for explanations, \"location\" deals with places, and \"abbreviation\" seeks meanings of acronyms. None of these apply here, as the question is purely quantitative.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a number or quantity. The phrase \"how many\" is a standard interrogative for numeric inquiries, and the subject (\"types of dogs' tails\") involves counting discrete categories, which falls under quantities or measurements. Even though the question might be poorly phrased or contain a fragment (\"are there three\"), the intent is clear: to elicit a numerical response. This aligns with the definition of C04, which includes questions seeking numbers, dates, or measurements. The correct classification label provided is C04, confirming this analysis.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04 with high confidence, as the question's structure and wording unambiguously request a numerical answer."

It is not seeking a specific fact, a numerical value, or a location, but rather an explanation of the steps or principles involved in energy creation. For instance, this could involve concepts from physics, such as nuclear fission, chemical reactions, or renewable energy sources. The core request is for descriptive information that outlines how energy comes into existence or is transformed.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question would be a detailed, explanatory response, likely involving multiple sentences or paragraphs that break down the process. It might include definitions, examples, and step-by-step descriptions, such as explaining energy conversion in power plants or natural phenomena. The answer format is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers or dates required), nor is it focused on identifying a single entity or location. Instead, it demands a narrative or descriptive style, which is characteristic of questions that require elaboration and context.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"how\" and \"created.\" \"How\" is a question word that typically solicits explanations or processes, while \"created\" implies the origin or generation of something. These words point to a request for detailed information rather than a simple identification or classification. In contrast, if the question had used words like \"what\" (e.g., \"what is energy?\"), it might lean toward an entity or description category, but \"how\" specifically emphasizes the method or explanation. This aligns with the C03 category, which is defined by questions seeking explanations or definitions.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"how is energy created?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation of a process or concept, rather than requesting a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation. Energy creation involves describing mechanisms such as chemical bonds breaking and forming, nuclear reactions, or thermodynamic processes. This requires a descriptive answer that provides context, examples, and potentially definitions (e.g., what constitutes energy creation), which is exactly what the C03 category encompasses. For example, a response might detail how energy is created in stars through nuclear fusion or in batteries through electrochemical reactions. This contrasts with other categories: C01 (entity) would be for questions like \"what is energy?\" (seeking a definition of the concept), C02 (human) for questions about people, C04 (numeric) for questions like \"what is the energy output of the sun?\", C05 (location) for questions about places, and C06 (abbreviation) for questions like \"what does E=mc² mean?\". Since \"how is energy created?\" focuses on the \"how\" aspect, it necessitates a descriptive format, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a detailed explanation, which matches the C03 category. I am highly confident in this classification, as it aligns with the question's intent and the category's definition.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The question does not seek general information about beer but rather a specific instance that matches the advertised characteristic. This indicates that the question is focused on retrieving a named or specific object.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer should be a proper noun or a specific name, such as a brand (e.g., \"Budweiser\" or \"Guinness\"), as it is inquiring about which beer fulfilled the condition. The answer format is likely a single word or a short phrase, representing a concrete entity. There is no indication of needing a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, or any other format; the response should directly identify the beer in question. This suggests the answer is categorical and specific, aligning with the nature of an entity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"beer,\" which is a general term for an alcoholic beverage, and \"advertised,\" which refers to marketing or promotional activities. The phrase \"had ` ` three rings ' '\" is likely a reference to a specific branding, slogan, or logo, such as in the case of Guinness beer, where \"three rings\" may allude to its logo or a historical reference. These elements point to the question being about a particular object or thing. The use of quotation marks around \"three rings\" emphasizes it as a distinctive feature, but the primary focus is on identifying the beer, not the meaning of the phrase itself. No words suggest human involvement, location, abbreviation, or numerical quantity in a direct sense.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or concept—namely, a type of beer—that has a particular advertised attribute.

The core request is for the identification of a particular object or item, which in this case is a golfing accessory. The question does not ask for general information, a definition, or a broad explanation; it is focused on pinpointing a specific entity based on contextual details like the inventor and the patent date.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely a noun phrase or a short, specific name that identifies the golfing accessory, such as \"a type of golf club\" or \"a brand name like 'The Grant Patented Grip'.\" The answer format is not numerical, descriptive, or location-based; it is a concrete, tangible thing. Characteristics include specificity (e.g., it must be a golfing accessory), and the answer may involve historical or factual details, but the primary output is the entity itself. This suggests the answer is not about a person, place, or abstract concept, but about a physical or conceptual object.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"golfing accessory,\" \"patented,\" \"george grant,\" and \"december 12.\" \"Golfing accessory\" directly refers to a specific object or thing, which aligns with the C01 category (entity). \"Patented\" provides context about the origin of the accessory, but it does not change the core request for an entity. \"George Grant\" is a human element, but it is not the focus of the question; the question is about the accessory he patented, not about him. \"December 12\" is a date, which could relate to a numeric category, but the question is not primarily asking for a number or date; it is using the date to specify the context for identifying the entity. Overall, the phrase \"what golfing accessory\" is a strong indicator of a question seeking a specific thing, pointing to C01.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is fundamentally asking for a specific object or concept—the golfing accessory. The inclusion of details like the inventor (George Grant) and the patent date (December 12) provides contextual information to narrow down the search, but the primary information being sought is the identity of the accessory itself, which is a concrete entity. This aligns with the C01 category definition: questions that ask about specific objects, concepts, or things. In contrast, it does not fit other categories:  \n- C02 (human) is for people-focused questions, but here the human element is incidental, not the main subject.  \n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, but the question is not requesting one; it is seeking identification.  \n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers or dates, but while the date is mentioned, the question is not primarily about a quantity or measurement.  \n- C05 (location) involves places, which is not relevant here.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) concerns acronyms or short forms, which is absent.  \nThus, the question's focus on a particular golfing accessory makes C01 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a specific entity, and the classification is straightforward given the key elements.

It asks for the identification of a mountain, which is a physical location on Earth. The core request is to name or describe the mountain that held the title of the highest peak before Mount Everest was recognized, indicating a focus on spatial and geographical information.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a descriptive phrase referring to a specific mountain or mountains. For example, the answer might be \"K2\" or \"Mount Kanchenjunga,\" which are names of geographical locations. The answer could include contextual details, but it fundamentally involves providing a place name or location-based information. This format is characteristic of questions seeking spatial or geographical data, rather than numerical values, definitions, or other categories.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"highest mountain,\" \"earth,\" and \"mount everest.\" \"Highest mountain\" refers to a geographical entity, and \"earth\" emphasizes the planetary scale, reinforcing the spatial aspect. \"Mount Everest\" is a specific location, and the question contrasts it with the previous highest mountain, further highlighting the focus on geographical locations. These keywords align with the category of spatial information, as they involve identifying places rather than people, concepts, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about a geographical feature on Earth. Mountains are physical locations, and the query seeks to identify a specific one (the highest mountain before Mount Everest was discovered). This involves spatial information, such as the position and identity of a place, which is central to C05. While the question includes a historical element, it does not shift the focus to a description, numeric value, or abbreviation. For instance:\n\n- It is not asking for a definition or explanation (C03), as it seeks an identification rather than a detailed account.\n- It is not requesting a number or measurement (C04), as the answer is not expected to be a quantity like a height or date.\n- It is not about an entity in a broad sense (C01), as mountains are specific locations, but C01 could include non-spatial entities; however, C05 is more precise for geographical contexts.\n- It is not related to humans or human activities (C02), as no individuals or human elements are central.\n- It is not seeking an abbreviation (C06), as the answer requires a full name or description.\n\nThe classification is appropriate because the question centers on locating or identifying a place, making C05 the best fit based on the category descriptions.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05 with high confidence, as the question directly involves geographical locations and spatial information, aligning perfectly with the C05 category."

The key component is the word \"when,\" which indicates a request for temporal information, and the subject is \"the women's suffrage amendment,\" which refers to a specific amendment in the context of women's rights history. The overall intent is to find out the exact date or year when this amendment was officially ratified.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question is likely a date or a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., \"1920\") or a specific date (e.g., \"August 18, 1920\"). This suggests that the answer involves numbers or quantifiable data, as it requires pinpointing a point in time. The format is typically concise and factual, focusing on measurement or temporal markers, rather than narrative or descriptive elements.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"when\" and \"ratified.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that directly points to seeking a date or time-based information. \"Ratified\" refers to an official act of approval, often associated with specific dates in historical or legal contexts. The phrase \"women's suffrage amendment\" identifies a specific historical entity, but the question is not asking about its nature or details; it is focused on the timing. There are no words suggesting a description (e.g., \"what is\"), a location (e.g., \"where\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does X mean\").\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical value or date, which is a type of measurement or quantity. The word \"when\" clearly indicates a request for temporal data, and \"ratified\" implies an event that occurred at a specific time, often represented by numbers (e.g., a year or month). This aligns with the definition of C04, which includes questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. In contrast, it does not fit other categories: it is not about a general object or concept (C01), a person or human element (C02), an explanation or definition (C03), a geographical place (C05), or an acronym (C06). The focus on a precise date makes it numeric.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04 with high confidence."

This query is seeking information about the specific human groups that are of Polynesian descent and live in New Zealand. The core request is to identify the inhabitants, which implies a focus on people or human populations. The question does not ask for abstract concepts, objects, or other types of information; it is directly inquiring about human entities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer would likely be a proper noun or a specific name referring to a human group, such as \"Māori\" or a similar term, as this is a common reference in the context of Polynesian people in New Zealand. The answer format is not numerical, descriptive, or location-based but rather identifies a group of people. It may involve a brief explanation or definition, but the primary output is the identification of the human group, aligning with a human-focused response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words in the question include \"polynesian people\" and \"inhabit.\" The term \"people\" is a strong indicator of the human category, as it refers to a group of human beings. \"Polynesian\" specifies an ethnic or cultural affiliation, but it still pertains to humans. The phrase \"inhabit new zealand\" adds a geographical context, but the central element is the human aspect. Other words like \"new zealand\" might suggest a location category, but they are subordinate to the main query about people.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question falls under category C02 - human because it is primarily focused on identifying or describing human populations. Specifically, it asks about \"Polynesian people,\" which refers to a group of individuals with shared ancestry and cultural heritage. This involves human-related information, such as ethnic groups, their origins, and their presence in a specific area. While the question mentions \"new zealand,\" which could imply a location context, the core intent is to find out about the people living there, not the place itself. \n\n- It does not fit C01 (entity) because it is not asking about a specific object, concept, or thing; it is about people.\n- It does not fit C03 (description) because it is not seeking an explanation, definition, or detailed account; it is directly asking for the identification of the human group.\n- It does not fit C04 (numeric) because no quantities, dates, or measurements are involved.\n- It does not fit C05 (location) because, while a location is mentioned, the question is centered on the inhabitants rather than the place.\n- It does not fit C06 (abbreviation) because there are no abbreviations or acronyms in the question.\n\nThe use of \"people\" and the reference to Polynesian descent clearly point to a human category, as human questions often involve inquiries about individuals, groups, cultures, or demographics. In this case, the question is essentially asking for the name or description of the human inhabitants, which aligns perfectly with C02.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nBased on the analysis, the question is correctly classified under C02 - human, as it directly addresses human populations and their characteristics. I am highly confident in this classification, as the key elements of the question—such as the focus on \"people\" and the cultural context—unambiguously support this category.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

The core focus is on identifying a person, as the query directly asks for the name or identity of a president, rather than a general concept or object.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely to be a proper noun, such as a full name (e.g., \"Abraham Lincoln\") or a reference to a historical figure, since the question is inquiring about a specific president. The answer format does not involve numbers, dates, definitions, or abbreviations; it is centered on a human subject. This suggests a response that names or describes a person, aligning with categories that deal with human-related information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"president,\" which refers to a human position or individual, and \"lived at,\" which implies a human's life event or residence. These terms point to a focus on people or human-related details. While the location \"219 north delaware street, independence, missouri\" is mentioned, it serves as contextual information rather than the primary element being sought, as the question is not asking about the location itself but about the person associated with it.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under category C02 (human) because it explicitly asks about a president, which is a role held by individuals. This directly relates to human-related information, as presidents are specific people with biographical details. The query seeks to identify a particular human being based on their residence, which falls under the category of questions about people, individuals, or human-related topics. In contrast, if the question had focused on the address or its geographical details (e.g., \"what is the significance of 219 north delaware street?\"), it might lean toward C05 (location). However, here, the emphasis is on the person, making C02 the appropriate classification. This is further supported by the expected answer format, which involves naming a person rather than providing a definition, measurement, or acronym.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident that this question belongs to category C02, as it directly queries about a specific individual (a president) and their human-related attributes, such as residence, which aligns with the category's focus on people and human information."

It is not asking for a definition, a specific fact, a number, or a location; instead, it seeks detailed information about the causes or factors behind American Indians frequently leaving school. The focus is on providing reasons, which implies a need for descriptive or explanatory content.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a paragraph, list of factors, or explanation involving historical, cultural, economic, or systemic reasons. For example, the answer might cover topics like discrimination, lack of resources, cultural disconnection, or socioeconomic barriers. This format is not numerical (e.g., a statistic), not a simple definition (e.g., \"what is school dropout?\"), and not focused on a specific entity or location. Instead, it requires a narrative or detailed explanation, which aligns with categories that emphasize descriptive or explanatory content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"give a reason\" and \"oftentimes dropping out of school.\" \"Give a reason\" directly indicates a request for an explanation or justification, which is central to the description category (C03). The phrase \"american indians\" refers to a group of people, which could relate to human or entity categories, but the action (\"give a reason\") shifts the focus to explaining human-related phenomena rather than the people themselves. Other key phrases like \"oftentimes dropping out of school\" describe a situation, but the question is not asking for a definition of that situation or a specific instance; it's asking for reasons, which reinforces the descriptive nature.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question belongs to category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or detailed information about why a particular issue occurs. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek explanations, definitions, or in-depth descriptions, such as those requiring analysis of causes, effects, or contexts. In this case, the question is not inquiring about a specific entity (C01), a human or individual (C02), a numerical value (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it demands a descriptive response that provides reasons, which involves elaborating on factors like historical policies, cultural challenges, or systemic inequalities affecting American Indians and their education. This fits the description category's emphasis on detailed, explanatory information rather than simple facts or classifications.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's core request for a \"reason\" directly matches the definition of C03, which involves seeking explanations or detailed information, and the analysis of key elements confirms that no other category fits as precisely."

This indicates a request for spatial or positional information, likely related to rules or regulations in soccer. The key element is the location on the field where handling is permitted.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer would be a description of a specific area or zone on the soccer field, such as \"within the penalty area\" or \"in their own penalty box.\" This format involves a location-based response, which is typically a descriptive or rule-based explanation rather than a numerical value, definition, or abbreviation. The answer does not require a number, date, or abbreviated form, but focuses on a defined space.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nThe phrase \"where must a soccer goalie stand\" explicitly uses \"where,\" which is a strong indicator of a location-based question. Additionally, the context of soccer rules implies that the answer involves a specific area on the field, reinforcing the location category. Words like \"stand\" and \"handle the ball\" point to a spatial constraint, but the primary focus is on the position.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C05, \"location,\" because it is seeking information about a specific place or area where an action (handling the ball) is allowed. In soccer, the rules dictate that a goalie can only handle the ball within their penalty area, which is a defined spatial region. This is not about a general concept (C01), a person (C02), an explanation (C03), a number (C04), or an abbreviation (C06). The question is directly asking for a location-based rule, making C05 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C05 with high confidence, as the question clearly requests a specific area on the field, aligning with the definition of a location-based inquiry."

It is not requesting a specific fact, such as a date, quantity, or location, but rather information that helps clarify and differentiate these concepts. The core request is for detailed, explanatory content about how classical conditioning (which involves involuntary responses learned through association) and operant conditioning (which involves voluntary behaviors shaped by consequences) differ in their mechanisms, applications, and examples.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a paragraph or a structured explanation that includes definitions, key characteristics, and a comparison. For instance, the answer might cover elements like the historical origins (e.g., Pavlov for classical, Skinner for operant), the processes involved (e.g., stimuli and responses in classical vs. behaviors and reinforcements in operant), and examples that illustrate the differences. The format is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers or dates), not focused on a single entity or concept, and not about abbreviations. Instead, it emphasizes providing a comprehensive understanding, which aligns with descriptive formats.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases in the question include \"what is the difference\" and \"between classical conditioning and operant conditioning.\" These indicate a request for comparative or explanatory information. The word \"difference\" specifically points to a need for detailed descriptions that highlight contrasts, while \"classical conditioning\" and \"operant conditioning\" are concepts that require explanation rather than identification of a specific object, person, or acronym. There are no words suggesting a numeric, location-based, or abbreviation-focused query, reinforcing that the category should be descriptive.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information about psychological concepts. While the question mentions specific entities (classical conditioning and operant conditioning), it is not inquiring about them as standalone objects or things (which would be C01) but rather about their interrelationship and distinctions. The phrase \"what is the difference\" explicitly calls for a descriptive response that breaks down and compares the concepts, providing context and examples to enhance understanding. This contrasts with other categories: it is not about a human (C02), as no individuals are involved; not numeric (C04), as no quantities or measurements are requested; not location-based (C05), as no spatial or geographical elements are present; and not abbreviation-focused (C06), as no acronyms or shortened forms are mentioned. The core of the question is to describe and explain, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (99%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and language clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, which aligns with the C03 category definition."

The core request is to identify the U.S. state where a particular historical event—the election of the first woman governor—occurred. The question is not asking for an opinion, analysis, or multiple pieces of information; it is directly seeking a named location. The key element is the \"U.S. state,\" which indicates a geographical focus.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is a proper noun representing a specific U.S. state, such as \"Maine\" or \"California.\" It should be concise and fact-based, without requiring elaboration, dates, or additional context. The answer is likely to be a single word or a short phrase denoting a place, which aligns with the characteristics of a location-based response. There is no indication in the question that a numerical value, descriptive text, or abbreviation is needed.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe question contains several key phrases that point to the category:  \n- \"in what U.S. state\": This explicitly references a geographical location, using the term \"state,\" which is a common indicator of spatial information.  \n- \"was the first woman governor elected\": This part describes an event, but it does not change the primary focus; the question is framed around the location of that event.  \nNo other category indicators are present: no words suggesting numbers (e.g., dates or quantities), no focus on people or individuals, no request for definitions or explanations, and no abbreviations. The phrase \"U.S. state\" is a strong clue for the location category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question belongs to category C05 (location) because its primary objective is to identify a specific geographical place—the U.S. state where the first woman governor was elected. While the question mentions \"governor,\" which could imply a human element, the central inquiry is not about the person or her attributes but about the spatial context of the event. Category C05 encompasses questions that ask about places, including states, cities, or other geographical entities. In this case, the question directly seeks a U.S. state name, which is a defined location. Comparing to other categories:  \n- It is not C01 (entity) because the focus is not on the governor as an object or concept but on the location.  \n- It is not C02 (human) because, although the event involves a person, the question is not centered on human-related information like biographical details.  \n- It is not C03 (description) because it does not ask for an explanation or detailed account; it seeks a straightforward fact.  \n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are requested.  \n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because there are no abbreviations or acronyms involved.  \nThus, the question's emphasis on a specific U.S. state makes C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and key phrases clearly align with the definition of C05, which involves spatial or geographical inquiries.\n\nFinal classification: C05"

The key elements are \"interesting facts\" and \"information,\" indicating that the user is seeking explanatory or illustrative content rather than a simple definition or a single piece of data. The question is not focused on identifying a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation, but rather on providing a broader, descriptive overview of the subject.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive and narrative in nature. It should include multiple facts, examples, or detailed explanations to engage the user's curiosity and provide comprehensive information. For instance, the response might cover historical origins, cultural significance, notable events, or practical aspects of dogsledding. This format suggests that the answer is not numerical (e.g., a count or measurement), not focused on a specific entity or location, and not about abbreviations. Instead, it requires a detailed, explanatory style that educates or informs, aligning with the need for elaboration rather than brevity or specificity.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"interesting facts,\" \"information,\" and \"about dogsledding.\" \"Interesting facts\" implies a request for engaging, detailed content that goes beyond basic definitions, often involving anecdotes, historical context, or descriptive details. \"Information\" is a broad term that signals a need for explanatory content. \"About dogsledding\" specifies the topic, which is a concept or activity (not a person, place, or abbreviation). Comparing these to the category descriptions, the question does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not just identifying \"dogsledding\" as an object; it's asking for more. It also doesn't match C02 (human), C04 (numeric), C05 (location), or C06 (abbreviation), as there's no focus on people, numbers, places, or acronym meanings. Instead, the emphasis on \"facts and information\" points strongly to a descriptive inquiry.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what are some interesting facts and information about dogsledding?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for explanations, definitions, or detailed information about a specific concept. \"Dogsledding\" is a topic that involves describing its history, mechanics, cultural impact, and other related aspects, which falls under the category of seeking descriptive content. For example, a response might include facts about the origins of sled dog racing, the breeds of dogs used, or famous dog sledding expeditions, all of which require detailed explanations rather than simple identification or numerical data. This aligns with the C03 category, which is designed for questions that request in-depth, narrative-like information to clarify or elaborate on a subject. In contrast, if the question was purely asking for a definition (e.g., \"what is dogsledding?\"), it might still lean toward description, but this version emphasizes \"interesting facts,\" making it more explicitly descriptive. The absence of any numerical, locational, or abbreviatory elements further confirms that C03 is the most appropriate category.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High, as the question's focus on detailed information and facts clearly matches the C03 category, based on the analysis of the question's intent and the provided category definitions."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"how much money are dumbo ' s ears insured for ?\" is inquiring about the insured value associated with a specific item, namely Dumbo's ears from the Disney character. The primary information being requested is a numerical amount of money, as it seeks to quantify the insurance coverage. This indicates that the question is focused on obtaining a specific quantity, rather than identifying an object, person, or other descriptive details.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is a numerical value, such as a dollar amount, a number representing the sum insured, or a date if it pertains to a policy term. Characteristics of the answer include being precise, measurable, and likely a large number (e.g., millions or billions of dollars, as is common with high-profile insurances). The answer should not be qualitative or descriptive; it must be a concrete number or a formatted numerical expression. For instance, a response might be \"$12,500,000\" or \"a sum of $5 million,\" emphasizing the quantitative nature.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how much money,\" which is a direct and unambiguous indicator of a numeric query, as it explicitly asks for a quantity or measurement. Additionally, \"insured for\" is a phrase commonly associated with insurance contexts, where amounts are specified. The mention of \"Dumbo's ears\" refers to a specific entity, but the question is not about the entity itself (e.g., what they are or where they are located); instead, it is focused on the monetary aspect. Other phrases like \"how much\" reinforce the need for a numerical answer, and there are no words suggesting human involvement, location, description, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it directly requests a specific numerical value related to insurance coverage. The core of the query is the insured amount for Dumbo's ears, which is a quantitative measurement. While \"Dumbo's ears\" could be considered an entity (C01), the question is not asking about the entity itself but about a numerical attribute associated with it, such as its insured value. This aligns with the C04 category description, which includes questions asking for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. The expected answer is a number, not a description or explanation, and the key phrase \"how much money\" is a strong indicator of a numeric focus. There are no elements that point to other categories: no human (C02), no description (C03), no location (C05), and no abbreviation (C06). Therefore, the question fits squarely into the numeric category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly asks for a monetary amount, which is a clear example of a numeric query, and there are no conflicting elements that would suggest a different category."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\nThe question is: \"where is procter gamble headquartered in the u s ?\" This query is asking for the specific location of Procter & Gamble's headquarters within the United States. The word \"where\" indicates a request for spatial or geographical information, and \"headquartered\" refers to the main office or base of operations. The phrase \"in the u s\" narrows the scope to a specific country, making it a question about a precise place or address. Overall, the question is seeking factual information about a geographical location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a specific location, such as a city, state, or address (e.g., \"Cincinnati, Ohio\" or a street address in the US). It may involve a combination of words describing a place, but it is not expected to be a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a definition. The answer should be concise and factual, providing spatial information rather than engaging in descriptive or numerical analysis. This aligns with the nature of location-based queries, where the response is typically a named place or coordinate.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"where\": This is a direct interrogative word that often signals a query about location or spatial information.\n- \"headquartered\": This term relates to the physical or organizational location of a company, emphasizing a specific place.\n- \"in the u s\": This phrase specifies a geographical context, indicating the question is focused on a location within the United States.\n- \"procter gamble\": This refers to a well-known company (Procter & Gamble), but the question is not inquiring about the company itself (which might fall under an entity category) but rather its location. The absence of words like \"what is\" or \"define\" rules out description, and there are no numbers or abbreviations involved.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it directly asks for geographical information about a specific place. The word \"where\" is a strong indicator of a location-based query, as it seeks spatial details rather than definitions, explanations, or other types of information. The term \"headquartered\" further reinforces this by referring to a fixed address or city, which is a common element in location questions. Additionally, the specification \"in the u s\" narrows the query to a particular country, making it a question about a precise geographical location. None of the other categories fit: it is not an entity (as it's not asking about the company itself), not a human (as it doesn't involve people), not a description (as it doesn't request an explanation or definition), not numeric (as it doesn't ask for numbers or dates), and not an abbreviation (as there are no acronyms or shortened forms involved). Therefore, the question aligns perfectly with the C05 category, which is designed for questions about places, addresses, or spatial information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence statement: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly uses location-indicating language and seeks a geographical answer, which matches the definition of C05."

The core information requested is the name of a geographical feature, which is a desert. This suggests the question is focused on locating or identifying a particular place, rather than asking about abstract concepts, people, or other categories.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a specific name of a desert, such as \"Sahara\" or \"Gobi,\" based on common knowledge or geographical references. The answer should be concise and directly identify the location. There is no indication of needing a numerical value, detailed explanation, or abbreviation interpretation, so the response is expected to be a straightforward reference to a place.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"desert,\" which is a geographical feature and a type of location, and \"garden of allah,\" which is a descriptive nickname for a specific desert. The phrase \"has been called\" implies a reference to a known association or title, but the primary focus is on the desert itself as a spatial entity. These elements point toward a question about a geographical location, as \"desert\" is inherently tied to a physical place on Earth.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is asking about a specific geographical feature—a desert—which is a type of place or spatial information. The category description for C05 explicitly includes \"questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" Here, the question directly seeks to identify a desert by its nickname, confirming it is inquiring about a location.  \n- Other categories do not fit as well:\n  - C01 (entity) is too broad; while a desert is an entity, the context specifies it as a geographical location, making C05 more precise.\n  - C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no mention of people or human elements.\n  - C03 (description) is not applicable, as the question is not asking for an explanation or definition but rather a specific fact about a place.\n  - C04 (numeric) is incorrect, as no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as \"garden of allah\" is a descriptive phrase, not an abbreviation or acronym, and the question is centered on the location, not the meaning of the phrase.\nThus, the question is best classified under C05 because it is fundamentally asking for information about a geographical location.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly seeks a specific desert, which is a geographical location, aligning perfectly with the C05 category."

This is a query about a specific biological concept, asking for the feature or characteristic that bicornate animals possess in pairs. The key information being requested is the identification of what these animals have two of, which implies a specific object, part, or attribute. The question does not seek personal information, numerical data, geographical details, or the meaning of an abbreviation; instead, it focuses on a factual aspect of a particular entity in the natural world.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a noun or a short descriptive phrase, such as \"horns\" or \"something similar,\" based on the context of bicornate animals (e.g., in biology, bicornate often refers to structures like horns or shells). The answer should be concise and directly address the query, providing a specific thing or concept. Characteristics include: it is not a number, date, or measurement; it does not involve human elements; it is not about a place; and it does not require expanding an abbreviation. The response is expected to be informative and fact-based, aligning with a definitional or factual query.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"bicornate animals\" and \"have two of\". \"Bicornate animals\" refers to a specific type of organism or concept in biology, indicating a focus on a particular entity. \"Have two of\" suggests possession or a dual characteristic, which points to seeking a specific thing or object. These elements align with the C01 category, as they involve questions about specific objects, concepts, or things. Other categories are less fitting: no human element (C02), no emphasis on explanation or definition (C03), no numerical aspect (C04), no location reference (C05), and no abbreviation involved (C06).\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what do bicornate animals have two of ?\" is classified under C01 (entity) because it directly asks about a specific biological entity—bicornate animals—and seeks information about a particular feature or attribute they possess. Bicornate animals refer to a defined group or concept in taxonomy, such as certain mollusks or invertebrates with two horns or similar structures. The query is not asking for a general description, a numerical value, a location, or an abbreviation; instead, it is inquiring about the entity itself (the thing they have two of, e.g., \"horns\" or \"bicornes\"). This fits the C01 category description, which encompasses questions about specific objects, concepts, or things. While the question could be seen as having a descriptive element, the core is about identifying a concrete entity or feature, making C01 the most appropriate classification. The correct label C01 confirms this alignment.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question centers on a specific biological entity and its characteristic, which directly matches the C01 category for questions about objects, concepts, or things."

It is asking for the identification of a sport that was promoted and had a standardized set of rules written for it by William Beers, who is described as a dentist. The core of the question is focused on the sport itself, which is a specific object or concept within the domain of sports. The mention of William Beers provides context for the query, but the primary information sought is the name or type of the sport.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a noun phrase or a specific name, such as \"lacrosse\" or \"field hockey,\" representing the field sport in question. This format suggests that the answer is a concrete or abstract entity, not a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, or a location. The answer should be concise and directly identify the entity, implying that it is a specific thing or concept being referenced. There is no indication in the question that it requires a date, quantity, or detailed explanation, so the answer is expected to be straightforward and factual.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases from the question include:\n- \"field sport\": This directly refers to a type of sport, which is an object or concept.\n- \"dentist william beers\": This mentions a person, but the question is not centered on the individual; it's about what he promoted.\n- \"promote\": This is an action, but it is used to inquire about the object of the action (the sport).\n- \"write a standard book of rules\": This is another action, but again, it is tied to identifying the specific thing (the sport) for which this was done.\n\nThese elements point to the question seeking a specific entity, as the focus is on identifying a particular sport rather than describing it, asking for a number, or locating a place. The phrase \"what field sport\" explicitly indicates a query for a thing or concept.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing—the field sport that William Beers promoted and wrote rules for. An entity category encompasses questions that seek identification or definition of particular items, such as sports, animals, or historical artifacts. In this case, the sport is the central subject, and the query is designed to retrieve its name or type.\n\n- **Reasoning for C01**: The question is not about a person (C02), as it does not focus on William Beers himself or his personal details. It is not a description or explanation request (C03), since it does not ask for details about the sport's history, rules, or significance; it simply seeks the identity of the sport. There is no numerical or quantitative aspect (C04), as no numbers, dates, or measurements are involved. It is not a location-based question (C05), as it does not reference geographical areas or spatial information. Finally, it is not an abbreviation query (C06), as there is no acronym or shortened form being asked about.\n\nThe question aligns with the C01 category because it is inquiring about a specific entity in the context of sports history. For example, similar questions like \"what animal did Charles Darwin study?\" would also fall under C01, as they seek identification of a particular thing. Here, the sport is the entity being identified, and the answer would be a specific field sport name.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01\n\nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question clearly targets a specific object or concept (the field sport) and matches the definition of the C01 category, while the other categories do not fit due to the absence of human focus, description, numeric elements, location, or abbreviation."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"what actor 's autobiography is titled all my yesterdays ?\". This is asking for the name of a specific actor whose autobiography has the title \"All My Yesterdays\". The information being requested is the identification of a human individual (the actor) and their autobiographical work. The core focus is on finding a person associated with a particular book title.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of an actor (e.g., a proper noun like \"James Dean\" or a similar figure), which is a human-related piece of information. The answer format is not numerical (e.g., no numbers or dates), not a location (e.g., no place names), not an abbreviation (e.g., no acronym meanings), and not a general description (e.g., no full explanation). Instead, it is a specific reference to a person, which aligns with a direct identification or naming task.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"actor\", \"autobiography\", and \"titled all my yesterdays\". The word \"actor\" directly refers to a human being, specifically a person in the entertainment industry. \"Autobiography\" is a human-related concept, as it involves a personal account written by an individual. The phrase \"what actor's autobiography\" sets up a query for identifying a specific human entity. These keywords emphasize a human subject rather than objects, concepts, locations, or abbreviations.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is primarily focused on identifying a person (the actor) and their human-related achievement (writing an autobiography). The category C02 is defined as questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information, which includes inquiries about personal histories, biographical details, or works created by individuals. In this case, the question is seeking the name of an actor, which is a human being, and the autobiography is a personal narrative. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) would apply to questions about objects or concepts, such as \"what is an autobiography?\" or \"describe the plot of All My Yesterdays?\", but here the focus is on the human author.  \n- C03 (description) might involve explaining or defining something, but this question is not asking for a detailed explanation; it's asking for a specific identification.  \n- C04 (numeric) would involve numbers, like \"how many actors have written autobiographies?\", which is not the case here.  \n- C05 (location) would involve places, such as \"where was the actor born?\", which is irrelevant.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding acronyms, like \"what does YMD stand for?\", which doesn't apply.  \nThe question's structure, with \"what actor's\" indicating a search for a human individual, and the autobiography being a human-centric topic, clearly points to C02.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly involves identifying a specific human being (the actor) and their human-related work, which aligns perfectly with the definition of C02."

The core request is to identify or describe this human being, focusing on their identity, background, or actions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer would likely be a name, a brief description, or details about the person, such as \"Reinhard Gehlen\" or \"an alias used by a Soviet spy.\" The answer format is not numerical, descriptive in the sense of explaining a concept, or focused on a location. Instead, it anticipates human-centric information, such as who the person is, their role, or historical context related to them. This suggests the answer is tied to a specific individual rather than a general explanation, number, place, or acronym.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases include \"russian master spy,\" \"lived in the u s,\" and \"under the name emil goldfus.\" These words directly reference a human subject: \"russian master spy\" implies a person with a specific identity and profession, \"lived in the u s\" describes a human activity or life event, and \"emil goldfus\" is a name that points to an individual. These elements emphasize the human aspect, as the question is centered on a person rather than an object, concept, place, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it primarily seeks information about a specific person or individual. The term \"russian master spy\" refers to a human entity, as it describes a person who is a spy, and \"under the name emil goldfus\" specifies a name associated with that individual. This is not a question about an abstract concept (C01), a definition or explanation (C03), a quantity or date (C04), a geographical area (C05), or an acronym (C06).

This is an interrogative sentence starting with \"where\", which is a common word used to inquire about spatial or geographical information. The core request is to find the location of the 19th hole on a golf course. Specifically, it seeks details about where this particular feature is situated, such as on a specific part of the course (e.g., the back nine or near a certain landmark). The question type is not about defining a concept or providing a numerical value, but rather about pinpointing a physical or conceptual place.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be descriptive and spatial in nature. For example, a response might explain the 19th hole's position relative to other holes, its location on the golf course layout (e.g., \"The 19th hole is typically on the home stretch of the course\"), or even provide directions. The answer could include terms like \"green\", \"fairway\", or \"tee\", but it should not involve numbers, dates, or definitions unless they are part of the location description. The characteristics of the response are focused on spatial information, making it distinct from categories that deal with quantities or explanations.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"where\", which is a direct indicator of a location query, and \"the 19th hole\", which refers to a specific feature on a golf course. While \"the 19th hole\" could be classified under an entity (C01), the question is not asking about the hole itself but about its location. Other phrases like \"on a golf course\" provide context but do not change the primary intent of seeking spatial information. These elements align with the C05 category, which involves questions about places or spatial details.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"where 's the 19th hole on a golf course ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it primarily seeks information about the spatial position or geographical placement of a specific element within a defined environment. The word \"where\" is a strong indicator of a location-based inquiry, as it demands answers that describe places, directions, or relative positions. In this case, the 19th hole is a fixed point or area on a golf course, and the question is not asking for its definition (which would be C03), its numerical attributes (C04), or its abbreviation (C06). While \"the 19th hole\" is an entity, the question shifts focus to its location, making C05 the most appropriate category. This classification fits the category description of \"questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information,\" as the response would involve describing the hole's position on the course, such as its location on the back nine or near the clubhouse. The analysis confirms that the question is not about a person, a number, or an explanation, but specifically about spatial information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key words clearly point to a location-based inquiry, and it aligns perfectly with the C05 category description."

It is not seeking a specific object, person, quantity, place, or abbreviation, but rather a detailed explanation or definition of the concept. The core request is for an understanding of why tornadoes exist or what their role is in natural processes.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer would be descriptive in nature, likely involving an explanation, definition, or detailed reasoning. For example, a response might discuss meteorological, ecological, or evolutionary aspects of tornadoes, such as how they contribute to weather systems or energy distribution in the environment. The answer format is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers or dates), not location-based (e.g., no specific places), and not focused on a single entity or abbreviation. Instead, it requires a comprehensive, explanatory response that elaborates on the concept.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"what's,\" \"nature's purpose,\" and \"for tornadoes.\" \"What's\" is a question word that often signals a request for information, while \"nature's purpose\" directly invokes a need for an explanation or definition of a concept. \"For tornadoes\" specifies the subject, but the central theme is the purpose, which is a common indicator of descriptive questions. These keywords suggest that the question is not about identifying a thing or a number but about providing detailed information, aligning with the \"description\" category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C03 - description).  \nThe question \"what ' s nature ' s purpose for tornadoes ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is seeking an explanation or definition of a concept rather than a specific fact, number, or location. The phrase \"nature's purpose\" implies a need for detailed information about the reason or function of tornadoes in the natural world, which requires a descriptive response. For instance, an answer might involve scientific explanations about tornadoes as part of atmospheric dynamics or as natural phenomena that aid in climate regulation. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about what a tornado is or a specific tornado example.  \n- C02 (human) is irrelevant as there is no human element.  \n- C04 (numeric) does not fit, as no numbers or measurements are requested.  \n- C05 (location) is not applicable, as the question is not about geographical places.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) is unrelated, as no abbreviations are involved.  \nThus, the question's focus on explaining a purpose makes it a clear case for the \"description\" category, as it demands a thoughtful, explanatory answer.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and keywords consistently point to a descriptive inquiry, and the category definition aligns perfectly with the need for an explanatory response."

The core request is for a method or location to find this information, which implies a search for a place or system where such data can be accessed. The question does not directly ask for a definition, a specific number, or a person's details; instead, it focuses on the spatial aspect of locating an address.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format involves providing a location or a reference to a place, such as a physical directory, an online service, or a specific database. For example, an answer might be \"in the phone book\" or \"online at a reverse phone lookup website.\" The answer is likely to be descriptive of a spatial or geographical context, rather than a numerical value, a definition, or a list of entities.

These elements align with the C05 category, which deals with places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is fundamentally asking for a place or method to access spatial information. The category C05 encompasses questions that seek geographical or spatial references, such as finding locations, addresses, or places. In this case, the question is not about a specific object (C01), a person or individual (C02), an explanation or definition (C03), a numerical value (C04), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it centers on the idea of locating an address, which is inherently spatial.

The word \"where\" is a key indicator, as it typically requests information about a location or spatial context. The question is not asking about the identity of Sarge Steel or the nature of the metal hand itself, but rather the place or position where the acquisition occurred. This suggests a focus on geographical or spatial details, such as a city, country, or even a fictional location.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a specific place name, a location description, or a reference to a spatial context. For example, the answer might be something like \"in a weapons factory\" or \"on the alien planet Xylos\" (assuming Sarge Steel is from a story or game). The format is not numerical, definitional, or explanatory in nature; it's primarily locative. The answer should provide spatial information, which could be a proper noun (e.g., a city or planet) or a descriptive phrase indicating a location.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe question contains several key elements:\n- \"where\": This is a direct interrogative word that strongly suggests a location-based query.\n- \"did get\": This phrasing indicates an action (acquiring) and implies a cause or origin, but the \"where\" specifies the spatial aspect.\n- \"his metal hand\": This refers to an object or condition, but the question is not focused on the object's properties; instead, it's about the location of its acquisition.\n- No other words like \"what,\" \"who,\" \"when,\" \"how,\" or specific numerical terms are present that would shift the category toward description, numeric, or other classifications.\n- The context implies a narrative or story-based scenario (e.g., Sarge Steel might be a character from fiction), but this doesn't change the core request for a location.\n\n#### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where did sarge steel get his metal hand?\" should be classified under category C05 (location) because it primarily seeks spatial or geographical information. The word \"where\" is a clear signal that the answer involves a place or location. In this case, the question is asking for the origin of the metal hand, which could be a specific venue, environment, or setting (e.g., \"in a futuristic lab\" or \"during a battle on Mars\"). This aligns with the C05 category definition: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\"\n\nTo further justify this classification:\n- The question is not about the metal hand as an entity (C01), as it doesn't ask what it is or its characteristics.\n- It is not focused on a human-related aspect (C02), even though Sarge Steel is mentioned; the core inquiry is not about the person themselves but the location of an action.\n- It does not request a description or explanation (C03), as it doesn't ask for details about how or why he got the hand.\n- There is no request for numbers, dates, or quantities (C04), such as \"when\" or \"how many.\"\n- It does not involve abbreviations or acronyms (C06), as there are no shortened forms or need for their meanings.\n\nThus, the emphasis on \"where\" and the spatial nature of the query make C05 the most appropriate category.\n\n#### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly uses the word \"where\" and focuses on spatial information, which perfectly matches the C05 category definition."

However, the answer format is not primarily numerical, descriptive, or abbreviation-based. Instead, it involves identifying a concrete entity or concept related to hair growth. The response would typically be a noun phrase or a short descriptive statement, emphasizing the physical or biological aspect of the entity in question.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"where,\" which often suggests a spatial or locational inquiry, and \"hair,\" which is a specific object or biological entity. The phrase \"grow the fastest\" adds a comparative element, but the primary focus is on \"hair\" as the subject. There are no indicators of a human, numeric value, date, abbreviation, or purely descriptive need. The word \"your\" might imply a personal context, but it does not shift the category to human-related questions, as the core is still about the entity \"hair.\" These elements point toward C01, as the question centers on a specific thing (hair) and its properties.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"where does your hair grow the fastest?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it primarily asks about a specific object or concept—hair. Hair is a tangible biological entity, and the question seeks information about its growth patterns, which involves identifying a particular location or condition associated with it. While the word \"where\" might evoke a locational aspect (similar to C05), the classification falls under C01 because the focus is on the entity itself (hair) rather than a general place or location. For example, if the question was purely \"where do people live?\" it might lean toward C05, but here, the subject is hair, which is an entity. The expected answer format, such as naming a body part or area, reinforces that the question is about a specific thing. This aligns with the category description for C01, which includes questions about specific objects, concepts, or things, even when spatial elements are involved.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly references a specific entity (hair) and its growth characteristics, fitting the C01 category despite the locational phrasing."

While the question mentions a historical figure (king), the central information being sought is the country, which is a specific location. This aligns with the category description for C05, which includes questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. The reign dates add context but do not shift the focus to a different category, such as numeric (for dates) or description (for explanations). Comparing to other categories:\n  - C01 (entity) could encompass countries, but C05 is more specific to locations, making it a better fit.\n  - C02 (human) is about people, but the question is not centered on the human element; it's about the country he governed.\n  - C03 (description) involves detailed explanations, but this question seeks a direct fact, not an explanation.\n  - C04 (numeric) deals with numbers or dates, but the main query is not numerical; the dates are contextual.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant here, as no abbreviations are involved.\n- Thus, the question is best classified under C05 due to its focus on identifying a specific country, which is a geographical location.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C05\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly requests a country name, which is a clear example of a location-based query, and the category description perfectly matches the information being sought."

The question does not focus on the river itself as an entity or its location, but rather on a property that can be expressed in numbers.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer to this question would likely be a numerical value, such as a number with units (e.g., \"approximately 2 mph\" or \"around 0.5 knots\"). It could also include a range or specific data points, but the core expectation is for a quantifiable response. This contrasts with questions that require descriptive text, explanations, or other non-numeric formats. The answer is expected to be concise and fact-based, focusing on measurement rather than narrative or qualitative details.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"speed,\" which is a term directly associated with measurement, quantity, or numerical data. Other relevant phrases include \"what is,\" which often signals a request for information, and \"mississippi river,\" which refers to a specific entity. However, the focus is on the attribute \"speed,\" which is a quantitative concept. This aligns with categories that deal with numbers or measurements, rather than entities or descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the speed of the mississippi river\" should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical value or measurement. The word \"speed\" indicates a quantity that can be expressed in numbers, such as velocity or flow rate, which falls under the definition of numeric questions provided in the category description. While the Mississippi River is a specific entity (potentially fitting C01), the question is not about the river in general but about a specific, measurable attribute. It does not involve people (C02), explanations (C03), places (C05), or abbreviations (C06). Therefore, the primary information being sought is quantitative, making C04 the most appropriate category. This classification ensures that the response will be a number or a set of numbers, consistent with the expected format for numeric inquiries.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C04\n- I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question directly requests a numerical measurement without any ambiguity or overlap with other categories."

The information being requested is the name or title of that particular film. It is not asking for a general concept, a numerical value, a location, or an explanation of terms; it is seeking a specific instance of a film entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or a specific film title, such as \"The Great North Field\" or another movie name. This format suggests a named entity, which is typically a concrete or abstract thing that can be referred to by a specific name. The answer should be concise and directly identify the film, without requiring additional explanation, definition, or numerical data. Characteristics include being a discrete object (in this case, a film) that is well-defined and can be looked up in databases or knowledge sources.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"film,\" \"marked,\" \"robert redford,\" and \"directorial debut.\"  \n- \"Film\" directly points to an entity, as it refers to a specific thing (a movie) rather than a person, place, or abstract idea.  \n- \"Robert Redford\" is a human name, but the question is not centered on the person; it is using him as a context to identify an entity (the film).  \n- \"Directorial debut\" is an event or concept, but the question is asking for the film that embodies this event, making it an entity question.  \n- Phrases like \"marked\" and \"directorial debut\" provide context but do not change the core request for an entity; they simply specify the type of film being sought. These words do not align with categories like C02 (human), C03 (description), C04 (numeric), or C05 (location). There are no abbreviations or acronyms present, so C06 is not relevant.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or thing—the film that marked Robert Redford's directorial debut. An entity category encompasses questions that seek named or identifiable items, such as films, books, or other tangible/abstract concepts. In this case, the film is a concrete entity in the context of cinema, and the question is focused on retrieving its name or title. This is distinct from:  \n- C02 (human), as the question is not about Robert Redford himself but about the film associated with him.  \n- C03 (description), because it does not ask for an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what is a directorial debut?\").  \n- C04 (numeric), as it does not request a number, date, or quantity (e.g., the year of release or box office figures).  \n- C05 (location), since no geographical or spatial information is involved.  \n- C06 (abbreviation), as there are no abbreviations or acronyms in the question.  \nThe core of the question is to identify a particular film entity, which fits perfectly with the C01 category's focus on specific objects or concepts.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly requests a specific film title, which is a classic example of an entity query, and the reasoning aligns with the category definitions provided."

The phrase \"second name\" suggests the user is seeking a particular aspect of Mao's personal identity, such as his given name or a middle name. The overall request is for factual information about this individual, which indicates a focus on human-related details.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a noun or a short phrase, such as a name or a descriptive term. For example, the answer might be \"Zedong\" or something similar, which is a specific identifier for Mao. This format is not numerical, descriptive (like an explanation), or location-based; it is a direct piece of information about a person. The answer is expected to be concise and factual, not requiring elaboration or multiple parts.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"what was,\" \"mao ' s,\" and \"second name.\"\n- \"what was\" indicates a question seeking a past or historical fact.\n- \"mao ' s\" shows possession, directly linking the question to a specific individual (Mao).\n- \"second name\" refers to a personal attribute or identifier, which is human-centric.\n- Comparing these to the category descriptions:\n  - \"entity\" might apply to objects or concepts, but \"Mao\" is a person, not an entity.\n  - \"human\" fits because the question is about a person (Mao) and seeks personal information.\n  - \"description\" would involve explanations or definitions, but this question asks for a specific fact, not a detailed account.\n  - \"numeric\" involves numbers, which are not present.\n  - \"location\" involves places, which is irrelevant here.\n  - \"abbreviation\" involves acronyms, which is not indicated.\n- The word \"Mao\" itself is a reference to a human, and the question is framed around his personal details, reinforcing the human category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what was mao ' s second name ?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it directly involves a specific individual and seeks information about their personal identity. Category C02 is defined as \"questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information,\" which includes inquiries about biographical details, names, or other attributes of humans. In this case, \"Mao\" is a human reference, and the question is focused on his \"second name,\" a personal fact. This aligns with the category's emphasis on human-centric topics, as opposed to abstract concepts, locations, or numerical data. The question does not seek an explanation or definition (C03), a number (C04), a place (C05), or an abbreviation (C06), making C02 the most appropriate fit. The simplicity of the expected answer—a specific name or term—further supports this classification, as it is directly tied to identifying or describing a human being.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question clearly centers on a human individual and seeks personal information, matching the definition of category C02."

It is not asking for a definition, a quantity, or an explanation of what hyenas are. Instead, it seeks specific places or regions, such as continents, countries, or ecosystems. The core information requested is the habitat or range of hyenas, which involves spatial data.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format for this question would typically be descriptive and location-based. For example, a response might include phrases like \"in Africa, particularly in savannas and grasslands\" or specify regions like \"South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.\" The answer is not numerical (e.g., no specific numbers like population counts), not a single entity or concept, and not focused on human elements. It is spatial in nature, emphasizing places rather than attributes or events.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"where,\" which is a strong indicator of a location-based query, as it directly asks for spatial information. Additionally, the phrase \"live\" implies habitation or residence, further reinforcing the focus on geographical areas. There are no words suggesting a need for a definition (e.g., \"what is\"), a number (e.g., \"how many\"), or a person (e.g., \"who\"). The subject \"hyenas\" is an animal, but the question is not about the animal itself or its characteristics; it is about its location.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"where do hyenas live?\" falls under category C05 (location) because it is explicitly asking for geographical or spatial information. The word \"where\" is a classic cue for location queries, and the context of \"live\" indicates a search for habitats or regions associated with the subject. Hyenas are known to inhabit specific areas, such as parts of Africa, so the answer would involve places like countries, continents, or ecosystems. This contrasts with other categories: it is not an entity question (which would ask \"what are hyenas?\"), not a human question (no people are involved), not a description question (it doesn't seek an explanation or definition), not a numeric question (no quantities are implied), and not an abbreviation question (no acronyms are present). Therefore, the question is best classified as a location query, as it focuses on spatial information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the clear indication of spatial information through the use of \"where\" and the absence of cues for other categories."

This phrasing indicates a request for identification or details about a person, likely seeking information about their identity, background, or role in a historical or social context. The use of backticks around \"queen mother\" may denote quoting or emphasizing the term, but it does not alter the core intent of inquiring about a human individual.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer to this question would typically involve a descriptive or explanatory response, such as providing the name, life story, achievements, or significance of the person referred to as \"the queen mother\". For example, the answer might include details like \"The Queen Mother was the title given to Queen Elizabeth, the widow of King George VI, who played a significant role in British society.\" This suggests a narrative or informative format, rather than a simple numerical value, location, or definition of a concept. The answer is likely to be detailed and human-focused, emphasizing personal attributes or events.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"who is\", which is a direct interrogative phrase commonly used to ask about people or individuals. The phrase \"queen mother\" refers to a specific human role or title, often associated with a real person (e.g., the Queen Mother in British history). While \"queen mother\" could be interpreted as a concept or entity, the word \"who\" explicitly ties it to a human subject. Other indicators include the absence of numerical, locational, or abbreviatory elements, which would point to different categories like C04, C05, or C06.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question \"who is the ` ` queen mother ' ' ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly asks for information about a person or individual. The term \"queen mother\" is a designation for a specific human being, such as the historical figure Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who was the Queen Mother of the United Kingdom. This falls under the \"human\" category as defined by the category description, which includes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. The word \"who\" emphasizes personal identification, and the expected answer involves describing or explaining the person's life, which aligns with human-focused inquiries. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because while \"queen mother\" could be seen as a concept, the question's framing with \"who\" makes it personal; it is not primarily about an object or abstract idea. It also does not align with C03 (description) as the description is a means to an end, but the core is about the human subject. There are no numerical, locational, or abbreviatory elements, so other categories like C04, C05, or C06 are not applicable.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and wording clearly indicate an inquiry about a human individual, supported by the context of \"queen mother\" referring to a specific person in historical or cultural terms."

The request is for an explanation of how bee hives interact with or contribute to cranberry bogs, indicating that the information needed is descriptive in nature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer to this question would likely be a detailed, explanatory response, such as a description of the ecological or agricultural role of bee hives, for example, explaining how they aid in pollination or honey production in cranberry bogs. The answer format is not expected to be a single number, date, or short phrase; instead, it should provide a narrative or detailed explanation. This suggests that the question is not seeking a numeric value, a location, or a concise definition, but rather an expanded piece of information that elaborates on the topic.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"what do bee hives do,\" which is a common interrogative phrase used to ask for explanations, functions, or reasons. The word \"do\" specifically implies an inquiry into actions or purposes, which aligns with descriptive questions. Other elements, like \"in cranberry bogs,\" provide contextual background but do not shift the core request away from seeking detailed information. There are no indicators of a numeric query (e.g., no words like \"how many\" or \"date\"), a location-focused question (e.g., no reference to places or spatial details), or an abbreviation (e.g., no acronym or acronym-based inquiry). The term \"bee hives\" could be interpreted as an entity, but the question is not asking about the hives themselves as objects; it's focused on what they do, which leans toward description.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question should be classified under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation or detailed account of the activities and functions of bee hives in cranberry bogs. This is evident from the use of \"what do\" which prompts for descriptive information rather than a specific fact, object, number, or location. For instance, an answer might describe how bee hives contribute to pollination, enhance berry production, or support biodiversity in cranberry bogs, which requires a narrative or explanatory response. While \"bee hives\" could be seen as an entity (C01), the question does not focus on identifying or defining the hives but on their actions, making C03 the appropriate category. There is no human element (C02), no numeric data (C04), no spatial focus (C05), or any abbreviation (C06) involved, further confirming the classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C03\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and wording clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, which aligns with the C03 category's focus on explanations and detailed descriptions."

    "label": "C03",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what caused the lynmouth floods?\" This is an inquiry about the origin or reason behind a specific historical event—the Lynmouth floods, which likely refers to the severe floods that occurred in the town of Lynmouth, UK, in November 1952. The information being requested is an explanation of the causes, such as meteorological factors, geographical conditions, or human elements that contributed to the event. It is not seeking a simple fact like a date or quantity, but rather a detailed account.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive, requiring a narrative or explanatory response. It may include details such as the role of heavy rainfall, poor urban planning, or environmental factors. The answer is likely to be textual and comprehensive, providing reasons or causes rather than a numerical value, a list, or a concise definition. Characteristics include the need for elaboration, context, and potentially historical or scientific explanation, which aligns with open-ended questions seeking depth.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what caused,\" which directly signals a request for an explanation or reason. Additionally, \"lynmouth floods\" refers to a specific event, but the focus is on its cause, not the event itself. Other indicators are the interrogative \"what,\" which often precedes descriptive queries, and the absence of terms like \"who,\" \"where,\" \"how many,\" or \"abbreviation,\" which would point to other categories. These elements suggest a descriptive nature, as the question is not about identifying an entity, human, numeric data, location, or acronym.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what caused the lynmouth floods?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the reasons behind the event. The phrase \"what caused\" explicitly seeks a descriptive answer, such as the factors leading to the floods, which requires a narrative or explanatory response. This contrasts with:\n- C01 (entity): Questions about specific objects or concepts (e.g., \"what are the causes of flooding?\"), but here the focus is on the cause of a particular event.\n- C02 (human): Questions involving people (e.g., \"who was responsible?\"), which is not the case here.\n- C04 (numeric): Questions asking for numbers or measurements (e.g., \"how many people were affected?\"), which is not requested.\n- C05 (location): Questions about places (e.g., \"where did the floods occur?\"), though \"lynmouth\" is a location, the question is not primarily about it.\n- C06 (abbreviation): Questions about meanings of abbreviations (e.g., \"what does LF stand for?\"), which is irrelevant.\nThe core of the question is to provide a detailed description of the cause, making C03 the appropriate category. The correct label C03 confirms this, as it encompasses questions seeking explanations or definitions.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key phrases clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, aligning perfectly with the definition of category C03."

    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question \"when is the tulip festival in michigan ?\" is inquiring about the timing of a specific event, the Tulip Festival, which is located in Michigan. The word \"when\" indicates that the user is seeking information related to time, such as a date, month, or specific period. The request is for temporal data, which could include a calendar date, season, or event schedule. The subject matter involves an event, but the core information being sought is the time aspect, not the event itself or its location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a numerical or date-based response. For example, it might be \"in May,\" \"the third weekend of April,\" or a specific date like \"April 15-20.\" This format involves numbers (e.g., month, day, year) or quantifiable time references, such as weeks or months. The answer could also include a range or specific quantity, but it is fundamentally not descriptive, explanatory, or location-based. The characteristic is that it requires a precise or approximate time reference, which aligns with the need for numerical data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"when,\" which is a direct indicator of temporal inquiry. Additionally, \"tulip festival\" refers to a specific event (an entity), and \"michigan\" specifies a location. However, the primary driver for categorization is the word \"when,\" which strongly suggests a request for time-related information. Other phrases like \"in michigan\" provide context but do not change the core temporal focus. In terms of category indicators, \"when\" is synonymous with seeking dates or numbers, which is characteristic of the C04 (numeric) category. There are no words indicating description, human elements, abbreviation, or pure location focus beyond the contextual details.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"when is the tulip festival in michigan ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it primarily seeks a time-based answer, which inherently involves numerical data. The word \"when\" explicitly requests information about dates, months, or specific times, all of which are forms of numeric information. For instance, answering this question might involve stating a month (e.g., \"May\"), a day of the month (e.g., \"April 15\"), or a year (e.g., \"2024\"), all of which are quantitative. While the question mentions \"tulip festival\" (which could be an entity) and \"michigan\" (which is a location), these are secondary elements that provide context but do not alter the main request for temporal data. The C04 category encompasses questions that ask for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements, making it the most appropriate fit. In contrast, C03 (description) would apply if the question asked for an explanation of the festival, C05 (location) if it focused solely on where it is held, or C01 (entity) if it asked about the festival itself without temporal reference. Here, the temporal aspect dominates, confirming C04.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this question belongs to category C04 because the core request for a specific time aligns perfectly with the definition of numeric information, including dates and quantities."

It is inquiring for the name of a particular film, which is a concrete thing or object. The request is for identifying a specific entity in the context of entertainment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as a movie title (e.g., \"Young Frankenstein\"), which is a named entity. It should be a specific, identifiable thing, not a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, or a list. The answer format is typically a string or phrase representing the entity in question.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words include \"movie,\" which directly refers to a specific thing or object in the domain of film. The phrase \"star in with\" adds context about collaboration but does not change the core request for an entity. There are no indicators of a human, numeric value, location, or abbreviation in the question. The focus is on retrieving a named entity.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or thing, in this case, a movie. A movie is a tangible concept that can be referred to by its title, making it an entity. The question does not seek information about a person (C02), an explanation or definition (C03), a number or date (C04), a place (C05), or an acronym (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular instance of a movie from historical or factual data. This aligns with the definition of C01, which encompasses questions about specific objects, concepts, or things.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- I am highly confident that the classification is C01, as the question directly requests a specific entity (the movie) without any ambiguity or overlap with other categories.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The information being requested is about the nature or kind of this particular object.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be a noun phrase or a short, specific term, such as \"suspension bridge\", which describes the type of bridge. It may involve a brief explanation, but the core response is categorical and not numerical, descriptive in a broad sense, or focused on other attributes. The answer format is concise and directly addresses the classification of the entity, without requiring a date, quantity, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"golden gate bridge\", which is a proper noun referring to a specific, named entity (a physical structure), and \"what type of\", which is a phrase commonly used to ask for categorical information. Other phrases like \"bridge\" suggest an object or concept. These elements align with the C01 category (entity), as they point to a specific thing rather than a person, place, number, or abbreviation. There are no indicators of human-related, descriptive, numeric, or location-based questions.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is inquiring about a specific, identifiable object—the Golden Gate Bridge. This bridge is a concrete entity, meaning it is a particular physical structure with defined characteristics. The phrase \"what type of\" seeks to classify this entity into a broader category, such as its structural type, which is a common way to describe entities. In contrast, C02 (human) would involve people, C03 (description) would ask for more detailed or explanatory information, C04 (numeric) would require numbers or measurements, C05 (location) would focus on geographical details, and C06 (abbreviation) would deal with acronyms or shortened forms. Here, the focus is on the entity itself and its classification, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the reasoning aligns with the category definitions and the question's structure clearly indicates an inquiry about a specific entity."

The key elements are \"stereo manufacturer,\" which indicates a request for an organization or company, and the quoted phrase \"slightly ahead of its time,\" which provides a qualitative characteristic or attribute. The overall request is to identify an entity based on a descriptive criterion, rather than simply retrieving a factual name or number.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is likely to be the name of a stereo manufacturer, such as \"Marantz\" or \"Bang & Olufsen,\" but the inclusion of the descriptive phrase \"slightly ahead of its time\" suggests that the answer may involve more than just a direct identification. It could require an explanation or contextual detail, such as why that manufacturer is considered ahead of its time. For instance, the answer might involve a brief description of the manufacturer's innovations or historical context. This implies that the response could be in a descriptive or explanatory format, rather than a simple noun or number.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nThe key words and phrases include \"stereo manufacturer,\" which refers to a specific type of entity (a company), and \"slightly ahead of its time,\" which is a descriptive term. The use of quotes around \"slightly ahead of its time\" emphasizes that this is not a standard fact but a subjective or evaluative description. Other indicators include the word \"what,\" which typically seeks identification, but combined with the descriptive element, it leans toward a category that involves detailed information retrieval. There are no numerical, locational, or abbreviatory elements present.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question should be classified under C02 (description) because it is primarily seeking detailed information or an explanation rather than a straightforward entity, numeric, or other type of response. While \"stereo manufacturer\" points to an entity (C01), the core of the question is the descriptive phrase \"slightly ahead of its time,\" which requires the responder to provide context, definition, or reasoning about the manufacturer's attributes. For example, answering this question might involve explaining the manufacturer's history of innovation, such as their early adoption of technologies that were not widely available at the time. This aligns with the C02 category, which covers questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information, as opposed to simply naming an entity (C01) or providing a number (C04). The absence of human, location, or abbreviation elements further supports this classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C02 with high confidence, as the question's structure and key phrases clearly indicate a need for descriptive information about a specific entity."

The core of the query is focused on identifying a particular entity in a descriptive or historical context. Here, \"Lifesaver\" is the central entity, which is a manufactured product, and \"flavor\" is a concept tied to it. This fits the C01 category definition of \"questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things\" because:\n\n- It does not involve a person (e.g., no question about who made it), so it's not C02.\n- It is not seeking a location or spatial information (e.g., where was it invented), so it's not C05.\n- It is not asking for a number, date, or quantity (e.g., how many flavors were there), so it's not C04.\n- It is not inquiring about an abbreviation (e.g., what does LS stand for), so it's not C06.\n- Instead, it is asking for detailed information about the entity itself, specifically its first flavor, which is a concept or thing related to the object. For instance, if the answer is \"citrus\" or \"orange,\" it is still providing information about the entity's characteristics.\n\nThis classification is appropriate because the question centers on retrieving knowledge about a specific, identifiable thing (the Lifesaver candy and its flavor history), which is the essence of C01.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence statement: I am highly confident in this classification because the question directly references a specific object (Lifesaver candy) and seeks a related detail (flavor), which aligns perfectly with the C01 category for questions about entities."

It does not require numerical data, spatial information, or an explanation of terms.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\n- Key words: \"who\" – This is a direct indicator of a human or person-focused question.\n- \"kept\" – This verb implies an action performed by a human, reinforcing the need to identify an individual.\n- \"the most famous diary\" – This refers to a specific entity (diary), but the question is not about the diary itself; it's about who kept it.\n- \"in the english language\" – This provides context about the diary's language, but it does not alter the primary focus on the human element.\n- Overall, the question uses language that centers on human agency and identity, aligning with the C02 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\n- The question falls under category C02 (\"human\") because it explicitly asks for information about a person associated with a famous diary. The word \"who\" directly seeks human-related information, such as the identity or background of the individual who kept the diary. For instance, the most famous diary in English is commonly linked to Anne Frank, and the question would expect an answer like \"Anne Frank\" or a similar human identifier.\n- This contrasts with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity) would be for questions about the diary itself (e.g., \"What is the most famous diary?\"), but here the focus is on the keeper.\n  - C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions (e.g., \"What is a diary?\"), which is not the case here.\n  - C04 (numeric) requires numbers or quantities (e.g., \"How many pages does the diary have?\"), which is irrelevant.\n  - C05 (location) deals with places (e.g., \"Where was the diary written?\"), not the primary concern.\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is for acronym meanings (e.g., \"What does 'diary' stand for?\"), which is not applicable.\n- The question's structure—asking \"who\" for an action related to a famous cultural artifact—clearly points to human information, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's phrasing and intent directly align with the C02 category, focusing on identifying a person."

The information in question is about \"top 1 singles\", which likely refers to a list or ranking of the highest-charting singles in music (e.g., from charts like the Billboard Hot 100). The request is not for the information itself but for the means or location to find it, making this a locational query.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format would typically involve a noun phrase or a descriptive statement indicating a physical or digital location. For example, responses might include \"on music streaming services like Spotify,\" \"at websites such as Billboard.com,\" \"in music magazines,\" or \"by checking online databases.\" The answer could also involve specific addresses, websites, or platforms, but it must pertain to a place or spatial reference.

These keywords collectively point to a query about spatial or locational information, aligning with the C05 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"where can i find out the top 1 singles ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it primarily asks for a place or source to access information, which is a core aspect of the location category. The word \"where\" is a direct cue for spatial or locational inquiries, and the context involves finding information through a specific location or method. While the information sought (\"top 1 singles\") relates to a concept (music rankings), the question is not asking for a definition, explanation, or description (C03), nor is it requesting a number or quantity (C04). It also does not involve people, objects, or abbreviations (C02, C01, C06). The location category (C05) encompasses questions about places, including digital or virtual locations like websites or databases, which fits perfectly here. This classification ensures that the response focuses on identifying the appropriate venue for obtaining the information, rather than the information itself.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and keywords clearly indicate a locational inquiry, and the classification aligns with the provided label."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"what spanish artist painted crucifixion ?\". This is an inquiry that seeks to identify a specific individual who fits certain criteria: they must be an artist from Spain and have created a work titled or related to \"crucifixion\". The core request is for the name or identity of this person, which implies a focus on human beings. The question does not ask for abstract concepts, objects, or other types of information; it is directly seeking personal information about a human subject.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as a full name or a commonly recognized title of a historical figure, e.g., \"El Greco\" or \"Miguel de Cervantes\" (though the latter is not an artist, it illustrates the point). The answer should be concise and directly identify the person, without requiring additional explanations, numbers, or details. This contrasts with categories like description or numeric, which would expect more elaborate or quantitative responses. The answer is expected to be a human-centric piece of information, such as a name, which is characteristic of the \"human\" category.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"artist\" and \"spanish\". \"Artist\" explicitly refers to a human profession, indicating that the question is about a person. \"Spanish\" specifies a nationality, which is a human attribute. The phrase \"painted crucifixion\" describes an action performed by this human, further reinforcing the focus on an individual. There are no words suggesting measurement, location, abbreviation, or general entity; the query is centered on identifying a specific human being. This aligns with the category description for C02, which is \"human\".\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what spanish artist painted crucifixion ?\" falls under category C02 (\"human\") because it is fundamentally asking for information about a person. The word \"artist\" directly points to a human individual, as artists are people with specific skills and backgrounds. The specification \"spanish\" adds a contextual detail about the person's origin, but it does not change the core request for a human identifier. The action \"painted\" is performed by a human, and the subject \"crucifixion\" is likely a reference to a famous artwork, but the question is not inquiring about the artwork itself or its description—it is focused on the creator. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) would apply to questions about objects or concepts, such as \"what is a crucifixion painting?\", but here the focus is on the artist.  \n- C03 (description) would involve explaining or defining something, like \"describe the crucifixion painting by a Spanish artist,\" but this question seeks a specific name.  \n- C04 (numeric) would require a number, such as \"how many artists painted crucifixion?\", which is not the case.  \n- C05 (location) would ask about places, like \"where did the Spanish artist paint crucifixion?\", but the question is about the person, not the place.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding acronyms, such as \"what does SPAN stand for?\", which is irrelevant here.  \nThus, the question is clearly human-focused, seeking the identity of a specific individual, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nI am highly confident that this question belongs to category C02, as it directly requests information about a human being (an artist) and aligns perfectly with the category's focus on people and human-related inquiries.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"what is a firewall ?\"\n\nThis is a straightforward inquiry that seeks an explanation or definition of the term \"firewall\". The phrase \"what is\" is a common interrogative used to request detailed information about a concept, rather than a specific fact, quantity, or location. The information being requested is not about identifying a particular instance or object but rather about understanding the nature, function, or characteristics of \"firewall\" as a concept. This suggests a need for a descriptive response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer for this question would be a textual explanation, definition, or detailed description. For instance, a typical response might include: \"A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.\" The answer format is not numerical (e.g., a number or date), not a simple list or identification of an entity, and not focused on spatial or geographical details. It is explanatory in nature, providing context and details about the concept. This aligns with categories that involve providing information rather than specific data points.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a classic indicator of a descriptive query. The word \"what\" often precedes questions seeking definitions, explanations, or detailed information. Additionally, the term \"firewall\" itself is a noun, but the question is not asking about a specific human, location, or abbreviation; it is inquiring about the concept's meaning. Phrases like \"what is\" are commonly associated with the \"description\" category (C03), as they prompt an elaborative response rather than a categorical or numerical one.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"what is a firewall ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or definition of a concept. Category C03 specifically covers questions that seek detailed information, such as definitions, explanations, or descriptions of how something works or what it is. In this case, the question is not requesting a specific entity (C01), which would involve identifying a particular object or thing; nor is it about a human (C02), which would focus on people; a numeric value (C04), like a count or measurement; a location (C05), such as where something is found; or an abbreviation (C06), which would require expanding an acronym. \n\nThe use of \"what is\" directly invokes a descriptive format, as it demands a response that elaborates on the subject. For example, answering this question would involve providing a definition, explaining its purpose (e.g., network security), and possibly its mechanisms, which is characteristic of C03. In contrast, if the question was \"who invented the firewall?\" it might lean toward C02, or \"how many firewalls are needed?\" toward C04, but here, the focus is purely on describing what it is. This classification is supported by the category description for C03, which includes \"questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information.\"\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that the classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question explicitly seeks a descriptive explanation, aligning perfectly with the C03 category."

The core request is to pinpoint or recall a specific place name or reference.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a descriptive phrase that names a location, such as \"Zanzibar\" or \"the Maldives,\" based on historical knowledge. It could be a single word, a compound noun, or a short phrase indicating a place. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or an abbreviation; instead, it expects a reference to a spatial or geographical entity. This suggests the answer is categorical and tied to a specific location.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"what was known as\" and \"spice island.\" \"What was known as\" is a common phrasing for questions seeking historical or alternative designations, but the term \"spice island\" itself is a compound noun that strongly implies a geographical or spatial concept. The word \"island\" directly references a physical location, and \"spice\" adds a contextual descriptor (e.g., relating to spice-producing areas). These elements point to a query about a place, as opposed to abstract concepts, people, or numerical data.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what was known as the spice island?\" is seeking information about a specific geographical location. Historically, \"Spice Island\" refers to places like Zanzibar or parts of the Maldives, which were renowned for their spice trade, indicating a spatial or geographical reference. The category C05 (\"location\") is defined as questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. This question fits perfectly because it is directly inquiring about the identity of a place, using \"spice island\" as a descriptor. It is not asking for a general explanation (C03), a number (C04), a person (C02), an object or concept (C01), or an abbreviation (C06). The focus on \"island\" and the historical context confirms that the key information being sought is spatial in nature, making C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly references a geographical term and seeks a location-based answer, aligning closely with the definition of C05."

The core request is to provide the name of a person, specifically a ranger character. This indicates that the question is focused on retrieving a proper noun or identifier for a human being, rather than a general concept, object, or abstract idea.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Ranger Smith\" or a similar identifier, which is textual and concise. It does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a descriptive paragraph. The answer should be straightforward and directly address the query by naming the individual, without needing additional context or calculation.

The information requested is about a particular attribute or component of this entity, which could be a physical object, symbol, or feature. The core of the question is to identify or describe something associated with the statue, rather than seeking a broad explanation, number, or location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a noun or a short descriptive phrase, such as \"shoes\" or \"a crown,\" which provides specific information about the entity. This format suggests that the answer is not a numerical value, a definition, or a location-based description. Instead, it is a concrete or symbolic object, indicating that the question is seeking factual details about the entity itself. The characteristics of the answer are tied to the entity's attributes, making it concise and object-oriented.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"statue of liberty,\" which is a proper noun referring to a well-known entity (a statue), and \"wear on her feet,\" which implies an attribute or part of that entity. Phrases like \"what does\" and \"wear\" suggest a request for specific details about the entity. These elements align with the C01 category, as they point to questions about specific objects or concepts, rather than people, definitions, numbers, locations, or abbreviations. The use of \"her feet\" adds a descriptive element, but the primary focus remains on the entity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it centers on \"the statue of liberty,\" which is a specific object or concept. Even though the question asks for what is worn on her feet, the core inquiry is about identifying or describing an aspect of this entity. In question classification, C01 covers queries that involve specific objects, concepts, or things, and here, the statue is the main subject. The answer will likely be another entity (e.g., \"the crown\" or \"shoes\"), reinforcing that the question is entity-focused. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C02 (human) is incorrect because the statue is not a person.  \n- C03 (description) is not primarily about explaining or defining; it's about a specific detail.  \n- C04 (numeric) involves numbers, which are not requested.  \n- C05 (location) relates to places, not relevant here.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms, which are absent.  \nThus, the question fits C01 as it seeks information about a defined entity and its attributes.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question clearly revolves around a specific entity and its characteristics, aligning with the C01 category definition."

This is a direct inquiry using the pronoun \"who\", which typically seeks information about a person or individual. The phrase \"superstar\" implies a notable or famous human being, and \"in rent a cars\" provides context, likely referring to a company, business, or service (e.g., \"Rent a Car\" as an organization). The core request is to identify or describe a specific human entity within that context, rather than seeking details about an object, concept, or location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format would likely involve naming or describing a person, such as a name, title, or brief description of an individual. For example, the response might be \"John Smith, the CEO of Rent-a-Car\" or something similar.

The word \"rent a cars\" might be a typo or shorthand for \"rent a cars\" (possibly meaning \"Rent a Car\" as a service), but even if interpreted as a location or organization, the question is still centered on identifying a person within that setting.\n\nThese elements collectively point to a human-related inquiry, as the primary information sought is about an individual.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C02 (human) because it explicitly asks for information about a person (\"who is...\"), with \"superstar\" emphasizing the human subject. The category C02 is defined as \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information,\" which matches the intent here. While \"in rent a cars\" could be seen as contextualizing the query within a business or service, it does not change the fundamental focus on a human entity. For instance:\n- It is not asking for a general definition (C03) or a numerical value (C04), as no numbers or measurements are involved.\n- It is not inquiring about a place or location (C05), as the core request is not spatial but personal.\n- It is not seeking an explanation or description (C03), as it asks for a specific individual rather than a broad explanation.\n- It is not related to abbreviations (C06), as no acronym or shortened form is being questioned.\n- It could be loosely tied to an entity (C01) if \"rent a cars\" is considered an object, but the question's emphasis on \"who\" overrides this, making the human aspect primary. The classification C02 is the most appropriate because the question is fundamentally about identifying a person, which is a core aspect of human-related information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and key words unambiguously indicate a focus on human identification, and the context supports this interpretation without ambiguity."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"What household facility contains a float ball, ballcock, and overflow tube?\" This is an inquiry about a specific object or thing in a household setting. The key elements are \"household facility,\" which implies a common item or device found in a home, and the list of components (\"float ball, ballcock, and overflow tube\") that must be contained within it. The information being requested is the identification of this facility, likely a noun or noun phrase that names the specific entity. The question does not appear to be seeking a broad explanation, a numerical value, a geographical location, or the meaning of an abbreviation; instead, it focuses on pinpointing the exact thing that includes these parts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a concise noun or noun phrase, such as \"toilet tank\" or \"water softener,\" as these are the types of household facilities that might contain the mentioned components. The answer should be specific and direct, without requiring elaboration, definition, or additional context. Characteristics of the response include being a named entity, possibly technical in nature (given the terms like \"float ball\" and \"ballcock\"), and focused on a physical object rather than a concept or abstract idea. This contrasts with categories like C03 (which might expect a descriptive paragraph) or C04 (which would require a number or measurement).\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"household facility,\" \"contains,\" \"float ball,\" \"ballcock,\" and \"overflow tube.\" \"Household facility\" suggests an object or device commonly found in a home, aligning with the \"entity\" category. \"Contains\" indicates that the question is about an entity that includes specific parts, further emphasizing the need to identify a particular thing. The terms \"float ball,\" \"ballcock,\" and \"overflow tube\" are technical terms related to plumbing fixtures, such as those found in toilets or water tanks. These words point to a concrete, physical object rather than a person, place, number, or abbreviation. While \"household facility\" could be interpreted broadly, the specificity of the components narrows it down to an entity category, as it's asking for the name of the thing itself.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for the identification of a specific object or concept that has particular features. The core of the query is to name the household facility that incorporates a float ball, ballcock, and overflow tube, which are all components typically found in devices like toilet tanks or similar plumbing fixtures. This directly matches the definition of C01, which is for questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things. In contrast, it does not fit other categories:  \n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as the question is not about people or individuals.  \n- C03 (description) is not applicable, as the question does not seek an explanation or definition but rather a direct identification.  \n- C04 (numeric) is incorrect, as no numbers, dates, or quantities are being requested.  \n- C05 (location) does not apply, as the focus is on an object, not a place.  \n- C06 (abbreviation) is not relevant, as there is no mention of an acronym or short form needing expansion.  \nThe question's structure—asking \"what\" with a list of contained elements—strongly indicates an entity-based inquiry, as it requires recalling or identifying a named thing. For instance, a common answer might be \"toilet tank,\" which is a specific entity fitting the category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01 with high confidence, as the analysis consistently points to the entity category based on the question's focus on identifying a specific household object with defined components."

It asks for the name of a particular dog that is associated with Betty Boop, a fictional character from cartoons. The information being requested is the proper name of that dog, which is a specific entity in popular culture. This indicates that the question is seeking a factual reference to a named thing rather than a general explanation, date, or location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Bimbo\" (based on general knowledge, but not used in the reasoning). It is a concise response that directly answers the query without requiring elaboration, definition, or additional context. The characteristics of the answer are that it is a single word or a short phrase, representing a named entity, and it does not involve numerical values, dates, or descriptive details. This format aligns with questions that focus on identifying or retrieving specific information about objects or concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"name,\" \"Betty Boop,\" and \"dog.\" The word \"name\" suggests a request for a specific identifier, which points to a question about an entity. \"Betty Boop\" is a proper noun referring to a well-known fictional character, which is itself an entity.

This is an inquiry about the activities, responsibilities, or functions associated with the profession of economists. It is not asking for a specific fact, number, or location, but rather seeks an explanation of what economists do in their roles, such as analyzing economic data, developing theories, or advising on policy. The core request is for descriptive information about a concept or profession.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a detailed, explanatory response. It may include definitions, examples, or step-by-step descriptions of economists' work, such as their methods, areas of study, and real-world applications. The answer is not expected to be a simple number, a list of entities, or a concise definition alone; it should provide depth and context. Characteristics include being narrative, informative, and potentially educational in nature, focusing on breaking down the concept rather than stating a single fact.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what do\" and \"economists do.\" The phrase \"what do\" often signals a request for an explanation or description of actions, while \"economists\" refers to a profession, which is a concept. This aligns with categories that involve explaining or detailing something, rather than identifying a specific object, person, number, place, or acronym. For instance, \"what do\" is commonly used in questions seeking definitions or breakdowns, which is characteristic of the description category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"what do economists do ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the profession of economists. This involves describing what economists study, how they work, and their typical activities, such as economic modeling, forecasting, or policy analysis. Category C03 is designed for questions that seek descriptive content, such as explanations or definitions, which this question clearly requires. It does not fit other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply to questions about specific objects or concepts (e.g., \"what is GDP?\"), but here the focus is on the actions of a group (economists).\n- C02 (human) would involve questions about individuals or people (e.g., \"who is an economist?\"), but this question is broader and not centered on a specific human.\n- C04 (numeric) would require a number or measurement (e.g., \"how many economists are there?\"), which is not the case here.\n- C05 (location) would ask about places (e.g., \"where do economists work?\"), but the question is about the profession itself.\n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding acronyms (e.g., \"what does C03 stand for?\"), which is irrelevant to this query.\nThus, the question's focus on explaining the role and activities of economists makes C03 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and content align perfectly with the definition of C03, which involves seeking descriptive information."

The information being requested is the name of a country, which implies a search for a spatial or locational fact. This is not a general inquiry about objects or concepts, but rather a focused question on identifying a place.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer is a proper noun representing a country, such as \"Australia\" or \"New Zealand,\" which is a categorical response indicating a specific location. The answer does not require a numerical value, date, or detailed explanation; it is a straightforward identification of a place. This suggests that the question is not seeking quantitative data or descriptive information, but rather a locational reference.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"country,\" which directly refers to a geographical location, and \"sheep population,\" which describes an attribute. The phrase \"what country\" is a common indicator for questions about places, as it prompts the identification of a specific area. These elements align with the \"location\" category, as the focus is on finding a country based on a characteristic, rather than on the characteristic itself.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is fundamentally asking for information about a geographical area. The category \"location\" encompasses questions that involve identifying or describing places, such as countries, cities, or regions, often based on attributes like population, size, or other spatial characteristics. In this case, the question is not about a general concept (C01), a person or human element (C02), a definition or explanation (C03), a number or measurement (C04), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it centers on locating a specific country by its sheep population, making it a clear fit for C05. This classification is supported by the fact that the answer will be a named place, which is a core aspect of locational information.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly references a country, which is a geographical location, and the attribute (sheep population) does not alter the locational focus of the query."

The focus is on the process of relocating a pet, which involves multiple considerations such as legal requirements, health checks, travel logistics, and possibly residency rules. The information being sought is not a single fact or data point but rather a comprehensive guide or explanation of what needs to be done. This indicates that the question is not inquiring about a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation, but rather about the details and steps involved in a particular scenario.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a descriptive, multi-part response that outlines the necessary steps, requirements, or guidelines. For example, it might include explanations of pet import regulations, veterinary procedures, documentation needed (e.g., health certificates, vaccination records), airline or shipping policies, and any local laws in Dominica regarding pets. The answer format could involve bullet points, numbered lists, or paragraphs that provide detailed information, making it explanatory and procedural in nature. This contrasts with categories like numeric (which would expect a specific number or date) or location (which might ask for a place's details without the procedural aspect). The answer is expected to be informative and explanatory, rather than concise or factual.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"what do I need to do\" – This phrase explicitly asks for actions, steps, or procedures, which is a strong indicator of a descriptive query.\n- \"take my dog with me\" – While \"dog\" refers to an entity (C01), the context here is not about the dog itself but about the actions required to transport and accommodate it.\n- \"live in dominica , west indies for a year\" – This specifies a location and duration, but the question is centered on the process of achieving that, not just the location details.\n- The overall structure suggests a need for a guide or explanation, as it is asking \"what do I need to do,\" which implies a request for detailed information rather than a specific fact.\n\nThese elements point toward the C03 category, as they emphasize the need for an explanation or description of a process. In contrast, if the question had asked for a definition (e.g., \"what is a pet passport?\"), it might still fit C03, but here it's broader and procedural.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed account of what actions are required to accomplish a specific goal—bringing a dog to live in Dominica for a year. This involves seeking information that is not categorical but procedural and explanatory in nature. For instance, the answer would likely describe steps such as obtaining a pet passport, ensuring vaccinations and health certificates, checking airline or shipping regulations, understanding Dominica's pet import laws, and possibly addressing residency requirements for both the person and the pet. This type of response is inherently descriptive, as it breaks down a complex process into understandable parts, rather than providing a single piece of information like a number (C04), a location (C05), or a definition (which could be part of C03 but is not the primary focus here).\n\nMoreover, the question does not fit other categories:\n- C01 (entity): While \"dog\" is an entity, the question is not about the dog itself but about the actions involving it.\n- C02 (human): There is no focus on people or individuals; the query is about the process for the user and their dog.\n- C04 (numeric): No numerical data is requested; the answer would not be a number or date.\n- C05 (location): While \"Dominica\" is a location, the question is not asking for details about the place but for the steps to relocate there with a pet.\n- C06 (abbreviation): No abbreviations are mentioned or implied.\n\nThus, the descriptive nature of the query aligns perfectly with C03, as it requires a detailed, step-by-step explanation to address the user's need for guidance on this relocation process.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly requests a procedural explanation of actions needed, which is a core characteristic of the description category, and it does not align with any other category based on the analysis."

This falls under the \"numeric\" category as defined in the available categories, which includes questions that seek numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. \n\n- The phrase \"how many years\" is a clear indicator of a quantity request, as it prompts for a count or measurement in time.\n- The concept of \"aged\" is inherently quantitative, as it refers to a specific duration that can be expressed in years.\n- The question does not seek a description (e.g., what is Johnnie Walker Black Label?), a location (e.g., where is it produced?), or information about people (e.g., who created it?). It is purely focused on retrieving a numerical fact.\n- In the context of whiskey, aging is a standard metric, and the answer would typically be a specific number (e.g., 12 years for Black Label), confirming the numeric nature of the query.\n\nThis classification aligns with the category description for C04, which emphasizes questions asking for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. The question is not about an entity in a general sense (C01), a human-related topic (C02), a detailed explanation (C03), a geographical place (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Therefore, C04 is the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the classification is correct, as the question directly requests a numerical quantity, and the analysis of key words and expected answer format consistently points to the C04 category.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

This indicates that the question is seeking a measurable output.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key phrases include \"how much would ... be worth\" and \"1 cent\". The word \"how much\" is a common indicator for questions seeking numerical information, such as prices, quantities, or measurements. The \"1 cent\" explicitly references a numeric value, and \"worth\" implies an economic or numerical valuation. Other descriptive elements like \"black and white\" and \"Thomas Jefferson\" provide context but do not alter the primary request for a number.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical value or quantity. The phrase \"how much would ... be worth\" directly seeks a quantifiable answer, such as a price or valuation, which aligns with the definition of numeric questions. Even though the question includes descriptive details about the stamp (e.g., its appearance and subject), these are merely contextual and do not change the core intent to obtain a number. For instance, if the question were \"What is the design of the stamp?\", it would be C03 (description), but here, the focus is on the worth, which requires a numerical response. The \"1 cent\" denomination further supports this by embedding a numeric element, making the classification clear.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C04\n- Confidence: High, as the question explicitly asks for a value and incorporates numeric indicators, leaving little room for misclassification."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"what country has the most time zones, with 11?\" This query is seeking a specific country that holds the record for having the highest number of time zones, which is 11. The core request is to identify a geographical entity (a country) based on a characteristic related to its spatial division (time zones). Time zones are a concept tied to geography, as they are defined by longitudinal boundaries and are administered by countries. Therefore, the question is asking for a particular location that meets a specific criterion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is a proper noun, specifically the name of a country, such as \"Russia\" or \"Canada,\" as these are the entities that can have multiple time zones. The answer does not require a numerical value or a definition; it is a direct identification of a place. The mention of \"with 11\" provides a specific detail to narrow down the search, but the primary output is still a location-based entity. This format aligns with questions that ask for names or identifiers of places, rather than abstract concepts or quantities.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"country,\" \"time zones,\" \"most,\" and \"with 11.\" \"Country\" is a specific type of location, falling under geographical entities. \"Time zones\" are a spatial concept, as they divide the Earth into regions based on longitude, making them inherently location-based. \"Most\" and \"with 11\" indicate a comparative or specific quantity, but they do not shift the focus away from the location aspect. There are no words suggesting an explanation, definition, number, or abbreviation, which are hallmarks of other categories like C03 (description) or C04 (numeric). This reinforces that the question is centered on identifying a place.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is fundamentally asking for information about a geographical area. Time zones are a spatial division of the Earth, and the query specifies a country as the entity in question. This means the answer will be a named place, such as Russia, which is known for having a large number of time zones. The category C05 encompasses questions that inquire about places, including those involving spatial attributes like time zones, boundaries, or regions. In contrast:\n\n- C01 (entity) could include countries, but it is broader and might apply to non-spatial entities (e.g., \"what is a smartphone?\"), whereas this question is explicitly tied to geography.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as no people or human elements are mentioned.\n- C03 (description) would involve explaining or defining time zones, but here the focus is on identifying a specific country.\n- C04 (numeric) might be considered due to the number \"11,\" but the question is not primarily about the number; it's using it as a filter to find a location.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is not applicable, as there are no abbreviations in the question.\n\nThe question's emphasis on a country with a specific number of time zones highlights its spatial nature, making C05 the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly seeks a geographical location based on a spatial characteristic, aligning perfectly with the definition of C05."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"what ` ` magic ' ' does mandrake employ ?\". This query is asking for the specific thing or concept that Mandrake uses or employs, with \"magic\" being highlighted and possibly referring to a particular term or entity. The core request is to identify what \"magic\" Mandrake employs, which implies a search for a specific object, concept, or thing in a contextual or domain-specific setting (e.g., in a story, game, or technical context). The question is not directly inquiring about a person, a definition, a number, a place, or an abbreviation, but rather about a specific entity that is being utilized.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format would likely be a noun phrase or a specific name that identifies the entity in question. For example, the answer might be something like \"a specific magic spell\" or \"a particular enchantment,\" depending on the context of Mandrake. The response should be concise and directly identify the entity, rather than providing a lengthy explanation, numerical value, or descriptive narrative. This suggests that the answer is focused on naming or specifying a thing, which aligns with categories that deal with identification rather than elaboration or measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"what\": This is a question word that typically seeks identification or specification.\n- \"magic\": This is likely the central entity being referred to, and the backticks (` `) around it may indicate that it is a specific term, acronym, or concept (e.g., from a technical, magical, or fictional domain).\n- \"does\": This word implies an action or usage, but it is part of the phrasing asking for what is employed.\n- \"mandrake\": This could refer to a person, character, plant, or system, but in this context, it is the subject employing something, so the focus is on what Mandrake uses.\n- The overall structure \"what X does Y employ\" suggests a request for a specific entity (X) that is associated with or used by Y (Mandrake).\n\nThese elements point toward a question that is seeking a specific object or concept, rather than a general description, number, location, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing that Mandrake employs. In this case, \"magic\" is the entity in question, and the query is focused on identifying what particular form or instance of \"magic\" is being used. This aligns with the C01 category definition, which covers questions about specific entities, such as objects, concepts, or things.\n\n- The question is not asking for a description or definition (C03), as it does not request an explanation of what \"magic\" means or how it works; it seeks the specific entity that Mandrake employs.\n- It is not numerical (C04), as there is no indication of numbers, dates, or quantities being required (e.g., no request for a count or measurement).\n- It is not location-based (C05), as the question does not involve geographical places or spatial information.\n- It is not abbreviation-related (C06), as there is no mention or need to decode an acronym or short form.\n- The use of backticks around \"magic\" may emphasize that it is a specific term or entity within a context, further supporting the classification as an entity question. For instance, in a fictional universe, \"magic\" could refer to a specific spell or artifact, making it a concrete entity.\n\nThus, the question is centered on identifying a particular entity, which fits squarely within the C01 category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly seeks the identification of a specific entity (\"magic\") in relation to Mandrake, matching the C01 category definition."

The word \"who\" is a direct indicator that the question is seeking information about a person. The request is for the name or details of the human being serving as the president, which involves human-related information. Therefore, the question type is focused on identifying a person, and the information being requested is about an individual in a leadership role.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely to be a textual response, such as a name (e.g., \"Michael V. Drake\") or a brief description of the person. It may include additional details like their background, but the core is an identification of a human individual. The answer does not require numerical data, a definition, a location, or an explanation of an acronym. Instead, it is designed to elicit information about a specific person, which is characteristic of human-related questions. This format suggests that the answer is not about an abstract concept or a place, but about a real-world human being.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"who,\" which is a pronoun specifically used to ask about people or individuals. Additionally, \"president\" refers to a human position, typically occupied by a person, and \"stanford university\" provides context for the specific human role being inquired about. These elements collectively point to a human-related inquiry, as they focus on identifying a person rather than an object, concept, place, number, or abbreviation. The structure \"who is [position]\" is a common pattern for questions seeking human information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C02).**\n- The question \"who is the president of stanford university ?\" directly asks for the identity of a specific human being, which aligns with the C02 category description: \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" The word \"who\" is a strong indicator of a human-focused question, as it seeks to identify or describe a person. In this case, the question is not about the Stanford University entity itself (which would fall under C01, entity), nor is it asking for a definition or explanation (C03, description), a number or date (C04, numeric), a geographical location (C05, location), or an acronym's meaning (C06, abbreviation). Instead, it is centered on the human individual holding the presidency, making C02 the most appropriate classification. This is further supported by the fact that the answer would typically involve a name or personal details, reinforcing the human aspect of the query.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Based on the analysis, the question is clearly asking about a person, specifically the president of Stanford University, which fits the C02 category. I am highly confident that this classification is correct, as it accurately reflects the human-related nature of the inquiry.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

The quote provided (\"let's get this goddamn thing airborne\") is contextual and likely refers to a real-world event or statement, but the core focus is on determining who (a human) issued this order. The question is not about a thing, concept, or event in isolation; it's centered on a human subject.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun or name of a person, such as a president, given the reference to \"presidential order.\" The answer should be concise and directly identify the individual, without requiring additional details like dates, locations, or explanations. For instance, a response might be \"John F. Kennedy\" or a similar name. The question does not ask for a definition, quantity, or spatial information, so the answer is expected to be a human entity reference. This aligns with queries that seek direct identification rather than descriptive or numerical data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases include \"whose,\" \"presidential order,\" and the quoted phrase \"let's get this goddamn thing airborne.\" \n  - \"Whose\" is a direct interrogative word that signals a question about identity, specifically pointing to a person.\n  - \"Presidential order\" implies a human-related context, as it refers to a directive issued by a president, who is an individual.\n  - The quoted phrase is informal and likely refers to a famous historical or political figure, but it serves as evidence for the human element rather than defining the category itself.\n- These elements collectively indicate that the question is probing for human-related information, as opposed to abstract concepts or physical locations.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question falls under category C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking about a person or individual. The word \"whose\" explicitly seeks an identity, and the context of \"presidential order\" ties this to a specific human role, such as a president. This is not a query about an entity (C01), as it's not asking for a thing or concept; nor is it a description (C03), as it doesn't request an explanation or definition. It also doesn't involve numbers (C04), locations (C05), or abbreviations (C06). The focus is squarely on identifying a human being, making C02 the appropriate classification. For example, similar questions like \"who wrote the Declaration of Independence?\" or \"who was the first woman president?\" are clearly human-focused, and this question follows the same pattern by seeking a specific individual's identity in a human-related context.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure and key elements—such as the direct use of \"whose\" and the human-centric context of \"presidential order\"—unambiguously point to the C02 category, which is designed for inquiries about people and individuals."

The request is for a breakdown or explanation of what makes this horse unique in a physical sense, rather than asking for a general definition or a single fact.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer would likely be a descriptive, detailed response that enumerates or explains various physical characteristics. For example, it might include details like \"Arabian horses are known for their dished faces, high tail carriage, and long, flowing manes.\" This format suggests a narrative or list-based explanation, focusing on providing information rather than a numerical value, a location, or a definition of an acronym. The answer is not expected to be a simple yes/no or a single number, but rather a comprehensive description.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"what are\" and \"distinct physical characteristics.\" The word \"what are\" often signals a request for a list or explanation, while \"physical characteristics\" directly refers to descriptive details about appearance or structure. These words align with the need for detailed information, which is characteristic of the C03 category (description). There are no indicators of a numerical query (like \"how many\"), a location (like \"where\"), or an abbreviation (like \"what does X mean\").\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under C03 (description) because it is seeking an explanation or detailed account of the Arabian horse's physical traits. This involves providing information that describes what the horse looks like, its distinguishing features, and how it differs from other breeds. For instance, the response might cover aspects such as coat color, body shape, or proportions, which are all explanatory in nature. This contrasts with other categories: it is not asking for a specific entity (C01, which would be more like \"what is an Arabian horse?\"), nor is it focused on human elements (C02), numerical data (C04), geographical locations (C05), or abbreviations (C06). The emphasis on \"distinct physical characteristics\" requires a descriptive format, making C03 the most appropriate fit.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests detailed information on physical traits, which aligns with the definition of the description category."

It is requesting information about a specific thing, which in this case is a psychological condition or phobia. The core of the question is to identify and describe what this entity represents, such as its definition, characteristics, or causes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive and explanatory. It should provide a clear definition, possibly including synonyms, etymology, or contextual details about \"fear of thunder\". For example, a typical response might explain that it is a specific type of phobia, often called astraphobia, triggered by fear of thunderstorms. The answer is not expected to be a simple yes/no, a numerical value, a date, or a list; instead, it focuses on delivering detailed information about the concept. This format aligns with seeking knowledge about a particular subject, rather than a quantitative or spatial query.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a common indicator of a question seeking a definition or explanation, and \"fear of thunder\", which refers to a specific concept or thing. The phrase \"fear of thunder\" can be broken down into components: \"fear\" suggests an emotion or condition, and \"thunder\" specifies the trigger, making it a concrete entity in the context of psychology or everyday language. These elements point towards a question about a defined object or idea, rather than a person, number, location, or abbreviation. The word \"what is\" reinforces the need for a descriptive or definitional response, but the focus on \"fear of thunder\" as a distinct concept aligns with the entity category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is a fear of thunder ?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object, concept, or thing. \"Fear of thunder\" refers to a particular psychological condition, often classified as a phobia, which is a well-defined entity in fields like psychology or medicine. The category C01 encompasses questions that inquire about the nature, attributes, or identity of such entities, even if the response involves a descriptive explanation. While the phrase \"what is\" might typically be associated with the description category (C03), in this case, the question is fundamentally about identifying and defining a specific thing (\"fear of thunder\"), which fits squarely within the entity category. The key information being sought is the definition and characteristics of this concept, making it an entity-focused query. This classification is supported by the fact that the question is not asking for a person (C02), a numerical value (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06).\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C01 with high confidence, as the question directly addresses a specific concept or thing, aligning with the definition of the entity category."

This is a straightforward inquiry that seeks a specific numerical value. The phrase \"how many\" indicates a request for a count or quantity, and the subject matter is the number of colleges located in Wyoming. The question is not asking for qualitative details, definitions, or explanations about colleges or Wyoming itself; it is focused on obtaining a numeric answer. The key elements are the quantifier (\"how many\") and the context (colleges in a specific state), but the core request is for a numerical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is a numerical value, such as an integer or a specific number, e.g., \"There are approximately 15 colleges in Wyoming.\" This could be a simple count or a more precise figure from a database or official source. The answer does not require descriptive text, dates, or measurements beyond the count itself. It is quantitative in nature, focusing on the amount or quantity of something, which aligns with categories that deal with numbers or measurements. The answer might include contextual information (e.g., specifying if it's community colleges or universities), but the primary output is a number.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"how many,\" which is a direct indicator of a numeric query. This phrase is commonly associated with questions seeking quantities, counts, or measurements. Other relevant elements include \"colleges\" (which refers to an entity, but the question is not about the entity itself) and \"wyoming\" (which specifies a location, but it is used as a filter for the count). There are no words suggesting description (e.g., \"what is,\" \"define\"), abbreviation (e.g., \"what does XX mean\"), or human-related information (e.g., \"who,\" \"about people\"). The focus on \"how many\" overrides any contextual clues about entities or locations, making \"numeric\" the most appropriate category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"how many colleges are in wyoming\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly requests a numerical answer. The word \"how many\" is a linguistic cue that signals a demand for quantification, such as a count or statistic. While the question mentions \"colleges\" (which could fall under C01, entity) and \"wyoming\" (which could relate to C05, location), these are merely contextual modifiers. The primary intent is to obtain a number, not to describe, define, or locate anything. For instance, if the question were \"what is a college?\" it would be C03 (description), or if it were \"who founded the first college in Wyoming?\" it would be C02 (human). However, here, the focus is solely on the quantity, which is a core aspect of the numeric category. This classification ensures that the response is treated as a data retrieval for a count, aligning with the definition of C04, which includes questions about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and key phrases unambiguously point to a numeric query, and it aligns perfectly with the category descriptions provided."

It is not simply asking for a list of colleges or a factual definition of what a college is. Instead, it seeks an evaluation or comparison to determine which college is considered the best, which implies a need for descriptive information. The key element is the word \"best,\" which introduces a subjective or comparative aspect, indicating that the answer should involve reasoning, criteria, or justification rather than just a straightforward identification.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely to be descriptive, involving a detailed explanation, such as a name or names of colleges along with reasons or supporting details (e.g., \"Harvard University is often considered the best due to its historical prestige, research output, and rankings\"). It may not be a simple numerical value or a location, but could include elements of comparison or opinion. The answer might reference external factors like rankings, achievements, or societal perceptions, making it more explanatory in nature. This contrasts with a direct factual answer like a date or a specific measurement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"best,\" \"college,\" and \"country.\"\n- \"Best\" is a comparative term that suggests evaluation, ranking, or description, as it requires explaining why something is considered the best.\n- \"College\" refers to an entity, but the question is not just about identifying an entity; it's about describing which one is the best.\n- \"In the country\" provides context but does not shift the focus to a location or numeric aspect; it remains part of the descriptive query.\n- These elements point towards a category that involves explaining or detailing information, rather than a simple fact retrieval.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the best college in the country ?\" should be classified under C02 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about what constitutes the best college. This involves more than just stating a fact; it requires a descriptive response that may include criteria, comparisons, or subjective judgments. For example, an answer might involve discussing factors like academic reputation, alumni success, or rankings, which falls under the \"description\" category as per the provided definition.\n- To contrast with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity): This category is for questions about specific objects or concepts, such as \"what is a college?\" or \"identify Harvard University.\" However, the word \"best\" transforms this into a descriptive query, not a simple entity identification.\n  - C02 (description): This fits perfectly because the question demands a detailed explanation or justification, making it inherently descriptive.\n  - C03 (numeric): No numbers, dates, or quantities are involved, so this does not apply.\n  - C04 (numeric): Same as above; no measurement or count is requested.\n  - C05 (location): While \"country\" is mentioned, the question is not focused on geographical details; it's about the college itself.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): No abbreviations are referenced or implied.\n- Therefore, the question aligns with C02 due to its evaluative and explanatory nature, which is central to the description category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly uses comparative language (\"best\") that necessitates a descriptive response, and it matches the category definition of seeking explanations or detailed information."

There are no indicators of a human, numeric value, location, or abbreviation in the question, which helps rule out other categories.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question \"what is viscosity?\" should be classified under C03 (description) because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a concept. Viscosity is a scientific term related to fluid dynamics, and the question seeks to understand its meaning, which involves providing a descriptive account rather than identifying a specific entity (C01), a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The use of \"what is\" explicitly signals a need for descriptive content, and the answer would typically involve explaining the concept in detail, making it a clear fit for the description category. This classification aligns with the category's focus on questions that require explanatory or definitional responses.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nI am highly confident that the classification is C03, as the question directly matches the criteria for seeking descriptive information.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The phrase \"Nordic nations\" refers to a collection of nations in Northern Europe, often associated with the Nordic Council or similar groupings. The primary information being requested is the identification and possibly the list of these nations, which are defined by their geographical and cultural context.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format would likely involve a list of country names or a brief description of the region, such as \"The Nordic nations include Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and sometimes Greenland.\" This format is descriptive but focuses on spatial and geographical details rather than numerical data, definitions, or personal information. The answer does not require a specific number or date, but rather an explanation of the locations involved.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words in the question include \"Nordic\" and \"nations.\" \"Nordic\" is an adjective derived from \"Nord,\" which relates to northern regions, and \"nations\" refers to countries or states. These terms emphasize a geographical and spatial concept, as the Nordic nations are a group of countries located in a specific area of Europe. This usage aligns with categories involving spatial or locational information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what are the Nordic nations?\" is asking for information about specific places or regions, which falls under the category C05 (location). This is because \"Nordic nations\" refers to a group of countries in Northern Europe, and the query seeks to identify or describe these locations. The category C05 is defined as questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. In this case, the question is not inquiring about a single entity (C01), a person (C02), a detailed explanation (C03), a numerical value (C04), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it focuses on the spatial aspect of the nations, making C05 the most appropriate classification. The answer would involve listing or describing countries, which are inherently locational.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly involves geographical locations and aligns perfectly with the definition of C05."

The core request is not about the content of the amendment itself (e.g., its definition or historical context), but rather about the spatial or locational aspect of finding it online. The phrase \"where on the internet\" indicates a search for a digital or virtual location, such as a website, database, or online resource.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a response that provides locational information, such as specific URLs, website names (e.g., \"Wikipedia,\" \"Legal Information Institute\"), search engine queries, or descriptions of online platforms. The answer format is not numerical, explanatory, or focused on definitions. Instead, it should guide the user to a specific \"place\" on the internet, implying a spatial or directional response. This aligns with the idea of providing coordinates or addresses in a digital context, which is characteristic of location-based questions.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey phrases in the question include \"where on the internet,\" which directly references a location. The word \"location\" is central here, and it is modified by \"on the internet,\" emphasizing a virtual or digital space. Other words like \"can i get information\" suggest a practical search for resources, but they do not change the primary focus on the locational aspect. In contrast, terms like \"what,\" \"who,\" \"when,\" or \"how\" might imply different categories (e.g., description for \"what,\" human for \"who\"), but \"where\" specifically points to location. This matches the C05 category description, which involves spatial or geographical inquiries.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for a place or location on the internet to find information. The category C05 is defined as \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In this case, the \"spatial information\" is interpreted in a digital context, as the question seeks a virtual location rather than a physical one. The phrase \"on the internet\" clarifies that the location is online, but it does not alter the core request for a place to access information. \n\n- Why not other categories?\n  - C01 (entity): This category involves questions about specific objects, concepts, or things (e.g., \"What is the Fifth Amendment?\"). The question does not ask for a definition or explanation of the amendment itself; it asks where to find information about it.\n  - C02 (human): There is no mention of people, individuals, or human-related aspects in the question, so this does not apply.\n  - C03 (description): This category is for questions seeking explanations, definitions, or detailed information (e.g., \"Explain the Fifth Amendment\"). The question is not asking for a description but for a location to obtain such information.\n  - C04 (numeric): The question does not involve numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements (e.g., \"How many amendments are there?\").\n  - C06 (abbreviation): There are no abbreviations or acronyms mentioned in the question (e.g., \"What does C05 stand for?\").\n\nThe question's focus on \"where\" indicates a search for a spatial reference, which is precisely what C05 covers. The internet is a medium for locations, and the query is about navigating that medium to find specific information, making C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question directly uses the word \"where\" in a locational context, and the category C05 aligns perfectly with the request for spatial or virtual locations."

It is inquiring about a specific geographical relationship, where the answer should be the name of a state adjacent to Illinois in the northern direction. This indicates a request for spatial or geographical information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be a proper noun, specifically the name of a U.S. state (e.g., \"Wisconsin\" or \"Michigan\"), as this is a factual query about borders. The answer does not require a numerical value, date, detailed explanation, or abbreviation, but rather a concise location-based response.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"U.S. state,\" \"borders,\" \"Illinois,\" and \"north.\" \"U.S. state\" refers to a political division, but in this context, it is part of a spatial query. \"Borders\" implies adjacency or spatial relationship, and \"north\" specifies a directional component. These elements highlight a focus on geographical locations and spatial information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question is centered on identifying a specific place (a U.S. state) that has a defined spatial relationship to another location (Illinois). This directly involves asking about a geographical location or boundary, which aligns with the C05 category (\"location\"). While \"U.S. state\" could be interpreted under C01 (entity) due to its reference to a political object, the context of \"borders\" and \"north\" emphasizes spatial orientation, making C05 more appropriate.

The core information being sought is an example of a film entity, meaning a particular movie or cinematic work. The question does not ask for general information about films or Jude Law; it focuses on identifying a concrete instance. The subject \"Jude Law\" is mentioned as a contextual reference, but the primary action is \"name a film,\" which indicates a need for a specific object or thing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is a proper noun, specifically the title of a film (e.g., \"Skyfall\" or \"Troy\"). This is characterized by being a named entity, which is typically a string of words that represents a distinct thing in a factual or categorical sense. The answer does not require a numerical value, a descriptive explanation, or any other format; it simply needs to be a specific film name. This aligns with the characteristics of an entity, as defined in the category C01, which involves questions seeking specific objects or concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"film\" and \"name a film,\" which directly reference a specific object or thing. \"Film\" is a clear indicator of an entity category, as it denotes a tangible concept like a movie. The mention of \"Jude Law acted\" provides context but does not change the core request; it is a modifier specifying the type of film. Other potential keywords like \"acted\" might suggest a human element, but the question is not centered on a person; it is focused on the film entity. This contrasts with categories like C02 (human), which would involve direct queries about people.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific film, which is an object or concept within the domain of entertainment or media. C01 encompasses questions that seek particular instances of entities, such as objects, ideas, or things, rather than abstract descriptions, human-related details, or numerical data. In this case, the question is not about defining what a film is (which would be C03) or about Jude Law himself (which would be C02). Instead, it requires identifying a named film, making it a direct query for an entity. The phrase \"name a film\" explicitly calls for a specific thing, and the inclusion of \"Jude Law acted\" serves as a filter to narrow down the entity to one associated with that actor. This classification fits the category description, as it involves asking about a specific object (the film) in a particular context.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question clearly requests a specific film title, which aligns with the definition of an entity category."

This question is inquiring about the nature or definition of \"a fear of bees\". The phrase \"what is\" typically indicates a request for information about something, and in this case, it's seeking to understand what \"a fear of bees\" represents. Specifically, it's asking for an explanation or definition of this concept, which could include what it is, its characteristics, or related details. The key information being requested is about the entity \"a fear of bees\", which is likely referring to a specific psychological condition or phobia, such as apisophobia.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive and explanatory. The response would likely provide a definition, explanation, or details about \"a fear of bees\", such as its causes, symptoms, or examples. Characteristics of the answer include being textual and informative, rather than numerical, locational, or abbreviated. It does not require a specific number, date, or measurement, nor does it focus on a person or place. The answer is meant to clarify or define the concept, which aligns with providing detailed information about an entity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a common indicator of questions seeking definitions or explanations. Additionally, \"a fear of bees\" contains \"bees\", which is a specific object, and \"fear\", which is a concept. Together, these form a reference to a particular thing or idea. There are no words suggesting a human element (e.g., names or people), no numerical or quantitative aspect (e.g., numbers or dates), no geographical reference (e.g., locations), and no abbreviation (e.g., acronyms or shortened forms). The phrase \"what is\" can appear in both entity and description categories, but in this context, it is used to ask about the identity or nature of a specific concept, pointing towards an entity.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"what is a fear of bees ?\" should be classified under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about a specific object, concept, or thing. \"A fear of bees\" refers to a particular psychological entity, such as a phobia, which is a defined concept in psychology. The category C01 encompasses questions that inquire about the nature, definition, or characteristics of such entities, even if the answer involves descriptive details. While the question could be seen as seeking a description (C03), the core focus is on identifying the entity itself rather than providing an extensive explanation. For instance, asking \"what is democracy?\" is typically classified as an entity question because it seeks to define the concept, whereas \"what are the effects of democracy?\" might lean more towards description. Here, \"what is a fear of bees ?\" is directly asking for what the entity is, making C01 the most appropriate classification. There is no overlap with other categories, as the question does not involve people, numbers, locations, or abbreviations.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that the classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question clearly targets a specific concept or thing, aligning with the definition of C01."

The information being requested is not a simple fact like a name, date, or quantity; instead, it requires a descriptive response that explains what a green bog is, potentially including its definition, features, and context. For example, the answer might describe it as a type of wetland ecosystem with specific attributes, such as its appearance, composition, or ecological role. This step focuses on the intent of the question, which is to gain knowledge about the concept rather than to identify a specific entity or perform a calculation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a textual explanation, definition, or detailed description. For instance, a response might read: \"A green bog is a shallow, vegetated depression that holds water, often found in cold, northern regions, and is characterized by acidic, nutrient-poor soil and plants like sphagnum moss, which can give it a greenish hue.\" This format is explanatory and narrative, emphasizing detail rather than brevity. The answer does not typically involve numerical values, dates, or specific measurements, nor does it require a list or a single fact. Instead, it is designed to provide comprehensive information, making it suitable for a descriptive category. The characteristics of the expected answer include being informative, explanatory, and potentially educational, aligning with the need for clarification or definition.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is,\" which is a strong indicator of a descriptive query, as it often precedes questions seeking definitions, explanations, or detailed information. The term \"green bog\" itself may refer to a specific concept or thing, but the question is not framed to identify it as an entity (like asking \"What is a car?\") or a location (like asking \"Where is the Eiffel Tower?\"). There are no words suggesting a numeric request (e.g., \"how many\"), a human element (e.g., \"who\"), a location focus (e.g., \"where\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does XYZ stand for?\"). The phrase \"what is\" is central here, as it directly points to a need for description rather than identification or quantification. This step highlights that the language used is typical of descriptive questions, which are common in educational or informational contexts.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"what is a green bog?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly seeks an explanation or definition of a concept, aligning with the category's focus on questions that ask for detailed information, explanations, or definitions. First, the use of \"what is\" is a linguistic cue that indicates a descriptive intent, as it prompts the responder to elaborate on the nature of the subject, rather than simply naming or categorizing it. Second, the expected answer format, as analyzed in Step 2, is descriptive and explanatory, requiring the responder to provide context, characteristics, and possibly examples, which is characteristic of C03 questions. Third, comparing this to other categories:\n\n- It does not fit C01 (entity), as while \"green bog\" could be considered a specific entity (e.g., a type of ecosystem), the question is not asking for its identification or basic facts; it is asking for a description, which goes beyond simple entity recognition.\n- It does not fit C02 (human), as there is no mention or implication of people, individuals, or human activities.\n- It does not fit C04 (numeric), as no numbers, dates, or quantities are requested or implied (e.g., \"how many green bogs exist?\").\n- It does not fit C05 (location), as the question is not inquiring about a specific place or spatial information; it is focused on the conceptual definition.\n- It does not fit C06 (abbreviation), as there are no abbreviations or acronyms involved.\n\nMoreover, in the absence of any numerical or locational elements, the question centers on providing a rich, descriptive response, which is the essence of C03. This classification is supported by the fact that descriptive questions often arise when someone encounters a term they are unfamiliar with and seeks to understand its meaning through detailed explanation.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question's structure and intent clearly align with the definition and characteristics of the description category."

The word \"where\" indicates that the information being sought is related to a place or location. Essentially, the question is asking for the geographical or spatial starting point of this myth, which involves identifying a specific area or region.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format would likely be a specific location, such as a country, city, or region (e.g., \"the Netherlands\" or \"parts of Germany\"). The answer could also include descriptive details about the location, but the core is spatial information. Characteristics of the answer include being a named place, possibly with historical or cultural context, but it must be tied to a physical or geographical location. There is no expectation for numerical data, dates, or definitions in the answer itself.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"where\" – This word strongly suggests a location-based inquiry, as it directly asks for a place.\n- \"origin\" – This implies a starting point, which, when combined with \"where,\" shifts the focus to spatial origin rather than temporal or conceptual origin.\n- The phrase \"myth of santa claus\" refers to a concept or entity, but the question is not about the entity itself (e.g., Santa Claus as a person) or its attributes.

The word \"where\" is a strong indicator of location-based questions, and \"origin\" specifies that the answer should involve spatial information rather than abstract concepts or people.\n- To further justify this, consider the nature of the question: It seeks the birthplace or starting point of a cultural myth, which is inherently tied to a specific location. For example, historical sources point to the Netherlands or Germany as the origin, making the answer location-specific.\n- Comparing to other categories:\n  - C01 (entity): This category involves questions about specific objects or concepts, but the question here is not focused on Santa Claus as an entity; it's about the origin, which is location-based.\n  - C02 (human): While the myth may involve human figures (e.g., Saint Nicholas), the question is not primarily about people; it's about the place where the myth originated.\n  - C03 (description): This would apply if the question asked for a detailed explanation or definition of the myth, but it does not; it asks for the location.\n  - C04 (numeric): No numbers, dates, or quantities are requested (e.g., no year or count of elements).\n  - C06 (abbreviation): No abbreviations are mentioned or implied.\n- Therefore, the question is best classified as C05 because it centers on spatial information, which is the defining characteristic of the location category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question directly uses the word \"where\" to request spatial information, and the concept of \"origin\" in this context clearly points to a geographical starting point, aligning perfectly with the C05 category description."

The primary information being requested is a specific location, such as a city, state, or address, which indicates a spatial or geographical focus.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is likely to be a concise location description, such as \"Cincinnati, Ohio\" or a similar place name. It may include details like the state or country, but the core response is a spatial reference. This suggests the answer is not numerical, descriptive, or focused on entities or abbreviations, but rather on pinpointing a physical or organizational location.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"where,\" \"based,\" and \"location.\" \"Where\" is a direct interrogative word that often signals a location-based query. \"Based\" implies a fixed point or origin, commonly associated with geographical or spatial contexts. \"in the u s\" provides contextual scope but does not change the fundamental request for a location. These elements align with the category C05, which is defined for questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the place where Procter & Gamble is headquartered, which is a spatial or geographical inquiry. The word \"where\" directly prompts a response about location, and \"based\" reinforces the need for a specific place. This is distinct from other categories: it is not an entity question (which would ask about what Procter & Gamble is), not a human question (which would involve people), not a description question (which would seek explanations or definitions), not a numeric question (which would require numbers or dates), and not an abbreviation question (which would ask for the meaning of an acronym). The focus here is purely on the spatial aspect, making C05 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C05 with high confidence."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking to \"name the soft drink\" that is associated with the phrase \"number one in the sun\". This indicates that the core request is to identify a specific soft drink brand or product. The phrase \"number one in the sun\" appears to be a reference or abbreviation, but the primary action is to provide the name of the soft drink, which is a specific object or entity.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is a specific name or label, such as \"Coca-Cola\" or \"Pepsi\", which is a textual representation of an entity. This suggests the answer is not a number, date, explanation, or abbreviation, but rather a direct identification of a thing. The question does not seek quantitative data, spatial details, or definitions, but focuses on naming a particular soft drink.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"name\", which implies the need to identify or specify something, and \"soft drink\", which refers to a specific type of beverage product. The phrase \"number one in the sun\" may serve as a clue or contextual reference, but it does not alter the fundamental request for a named entity. These elements point toward a question about a specific object or concept, aligning with the \"entity\" category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for the identification of a specific soft drink, which is an object or thing. The term \"entity\" in this context refers to questions that seek to name or describe a particular item, concept, or thing, such as a brand, product, or category. Here, the query is focused on retrieving the name of a soft drink, which is a concrete entity. While the phrase \"number one in the sun\" might be an abbreviation or reference (potentially related to a brand like SunChips, but the question specifies \"soft drink\"), the classification is based on the core action of naming a thing rather than explaining an abbreviation (which would be C06) or providing a description (C03). The question does not involve numbers, dates, locations, or human elements, further supporting the C01 classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly requests the name of a specific soft drink, which is a clear example of an entity question."

    "text": "what is the web address of the list of e mail addresses of members of the house of representatives ?",
    "label": "C05",
    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"what is the web address of the list of e mail addresses of members of the house of representatives?\"\n\nThis question is requesting a specific web address (URL) for a particular resource. The resource in question is a list of email addresses belonging to members of the house of representatives. The core information being sought is not about the content of the list or the individuals themselves, but rather the exact web address where this list can be found. This indicates that the question is focused on obtaining a locational piece of information, specifically a digital location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question is likely to be a string of characters that forms a valid web address (e.g., \"https://www.example.com/emails/house-representatives\"). This format typically includes elements like a protocol (http/https), domain name, and path. It is a concise, direct piece of information that specifies a precise point or resource in a digital space. The answer does not require explanation, definition, or numerical values; it is a straightforward identifier of a location. This aligns with questions that ask for addresses, URLs, or similar locational data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nThe key phrases in the question are \"web address,\" \"list of e mail addresses,\" and \"members of the house of representatives.\" \n\n- \"Web address\" is a direct indicator of a location, as it refers to a specific point on the internet.\n- \"List of e mail addresses\" specifies the content being located, but it does not change the fundamental request for a web address.\n- \"Members of the house of representatives\" provides context for the resource but does not alter the question's focus on obtaining a locational identifier.\n\nThese keywords emphasize the need for a specific URL, which is a type of spatial or locational information in a digital context.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is asking for a web address, which is a form of spatial or locational information. According to the category description, C05 includes questions about \"places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In this case, the web address represents a digital place or location on the internet, where the list of email addresses is hosted. This classification is appropriate because:\n\n- The question is not seeking a description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor is it asking for a number or quantity (C04). Instead, it is directly requesting a specific identifier that pinpoints a resource.\n- While the question involves a political entity (members of the house of representatives), the focus is on the web address itself, not on the human or organizational aspects. This distinguishes it from C02 (human), which deals with people or individuals.\n- The term \"web address\" is synonymous with a URL, which is a standard way to refer to locations online. Even though the category description mentions \"geographical locations,\" it can logically extend to digital or cyber locations in the context of modern information systems.\n- The analysis of key words and expected answer format confirms that the question is centered on locating something, making C05 the most fitting category. There is no ambiguity in the request, as it is clearly asking for a web address rather than an abbreviation or a general description.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the detailed analysis of the question's components, expected answer format, and alignment with the C05 category description.\n\nFinal classification: C05"
