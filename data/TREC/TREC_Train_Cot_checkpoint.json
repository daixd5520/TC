    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" This query is seeking information about specific movies that include or portray the character named \"Popeye Doyle.\" The core request is to identify or list films, which are media entities, and associate them with a particular character. The question is not focused on a single piece of information but rather on retrieving a set of related items, indicating a search for specific objects or concepts in the domain of film and entertainment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format would likely involve a list of film titles, a description of the films, or a set of facts about which movies feature the character. For example, the response might include names like \"The French Connection\" or other films where Popeye Doyle appears. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description. Instead, it anticipates a response that identifies or references specific entities (films) and their relationship to the character. This suggests an answer format that is informative but not purely descriptive, numeric, or location-based.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"films,\" \"featured,\" and \"character Popeye Doyle.\" \"Films\" refers to specific objects or concepts in the context of cinema. \"Featured\" implies association or inclusion, indicating a search for entities that contain or relate to the character. \"Character Popeye Doyle\" is a proper noun that denotes a specific entity, likely a fictional character from media. These terms point to a query about identifying particular things (films) that are connected to a given concept (character), which aligns with the definition of an \"entity\" category. There are no indicators of human focus, description, numeric data, location, or abbreviation in the question.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking about specific objects, concepts, or things in the context of film and media. The term \"films\" refers to tangible or conceptual entities (e.g., movies as cultural artifacts), and \"character Popeye Doyle\" is a specific entity within that domain. The question is inquiring about the films that include this character, which means it is seeking information about the relationships and instances of these entities. This does not fit C02 (human), as it is not directly about a person or individual; while the character might be portrayed by a human, the focus is on the film and character entities themselves. It also does not align with C03 (description), as it is not requesting an explanation or definition of the character or films. There is no need for numeric data (C04), location information (C05), or abbreviation meaning (C06). The question centers on identifying specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly asks about specific objects (films) and concepts (character) without any elements that would suggest other categories, such as human focus, description, or numeric requirements."

It is not seeking a direct fact or a single piece of data but rather a step-by-step guide or explanation on how to access or compile such a list. The information requested pertains to the procedure for finding the list, which involves understanding how to search for or retrieve data related to celebrities' real names.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be descriptive in nature, providing an explanation, steps, or advice on how to find the list. For instance, a response might include suggestions like using search engines, checking databases, or explaining the concept of real names versus stage names. The answer format could involve bullet points, paragraphs, or a combination of instructions and context, but it should not be a simple numerical value, a location, or a definition of a term. The characteristics of the expected answer are explanatory and procedural, focusing on detailing the process rather than stating a fact.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how can i find,\" which explicitly requests a method or explanation, and \"list of celebrities' real names,\" which refers to a concept or information set. These elements align with the category C03 (\"description\"), as they indicate a need for detailed information or a breakdown of the process. Other indicative phrases might include \"explain,\" \"what is,\" or \"how to,\" but here, \"how can i find\" is central to seeking a descriptive response.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (\"description\") because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation or detailed information on how to perform a specific task. Unlike categories that focus on specific facts (e.g., C01 for entities or C04 for numbers), this query requires a descriptive answer that elaborates on the steps involved in finding a list, such as searching online resources, using directories, or understanding privacy aspects. For example, a response might describe how to use Google, IMDb, or other platforms to compile such a list, which involves providing context and instructions rather than a simple fact. This contrasts with other categories: it is not about identifying a particular entity (C01), a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The use of \"how\" emphasizes the procedural and explanatory nature, fitting C03 perfectly.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's focus on seeking a method or explanation aligns clearly with the definition of C03."

    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\n### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" This query is seeking information about a specific animal or bird (\"fowl\") that follows the \"Chinese Year of the Monkey\" in the context of the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year associated with an animal sign. After the Year of the Monkey, the next year is the Year of the Rooster, so the question is likely referring to the rooster as the fowl that gains prominence or attention. The core request is for a specific entity, which is an object or concept (in this case, a bird), rather than a person, place, number, or explanation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a specific noun or short phrase identifying the entity in question, such as \"rooster\" or \"chicken,\" based on the zodiac cycle. This indicates a direct, factual response rather than a narrative, definition, or numerical value. The answer format is concise and categorical, focusing on naming or describing a particular thing, which aligns with the characteristics of a question seeking an entity. There is no indication of needing dates, quantities, or descriptive details, so the response is expected to be straightforward and entity-focused.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"fowl,\" which refers to a bird or poultry animal, and \"after the chinese year of the monkey,\" which is a cultural reference to the Chinese zodiac cycle. The phrase \"grabs the spotlight\" is idiomatic for gaining attention or prominence, but it does not change the core inquiry about the entity. Category C01 (\"entity\") is indicated by words like \"fowl,\" which denotes a specific object or concept, and the context of the Chinese zodiac, which involves defining and referencing particular animals as entities. Other categories are less relevant: no human is mentioned, no location or abbreviation is involved, and the question does not ask for a description or numeric value.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" is classified under C01 (\"entity\") because it directly asks for a specific object or concept—the fowl associated with the next year in the Chinese zodiac cycle. In this case, the entity is the rooster, which is a well-defined animal in the zodiac system. The question is not inquiring about a person (C02), as it focuses on an animal, nor is it seeking an explanation or definition (C03), a number or date (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular entity, making C01 the most appropriate category. The cultural context reinforces this, as the Chinese zodiac involves entities like the monkey, rooster, etc., which are specific concepts in the question.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification, as the question explicitly requests a specific entity (the fowl following the Year of the Monkey) and aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, while excluding all other categories based on the question's structure and key phrases."

    "label": "C06",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is \"what is the full form of com ?\". This is a query that seeks the expanded or complete version of the abbreviation \"com\". The core request is to provide the meaning or definition of \"com\", which is likely an acronym or shortened form of a word or phrase. The question type is focused on decoding a shortened expression, indicating a need for clarification or explanation related to a specific linguistic or technical term.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format is descriptive, typically a phrase or sentence that explains what \"com\" stands for, such as \"Computer Organization and Management\" or \"Commercial\" (depending on the context). It is not numerical, as it does not require a number, date, or quantity; nor is it location-based, as it does not ask for a place or spatial information. The answer is likely to be a textual explanation rather than a simple word or data point, emphasizing the need for interpretation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"full form\" and \"com\". \"Full form\" is a common phrase used when asking for the expanded version of an abbreviation or acronym. \"Com\" itself is a short form that could represent various terms (e.g., \"Communications\" in computing or \"Company\" in business), but the question is explicitly about its meaning. These elements align with the C06 category, which is defined for questions seeking the meaning of abbreviations or acronyms. Other potential indicators include phrases like \"what does\" or \"abbreviation for,\" but here \"full form\" is the primary cue.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question \"what is the full form of com ?\" directly falls under the C06 category (abbreviation) because it is inquiring about the meaning of an abbreviated term. Abbreviations are condensed forms of words or phrases, and questions that ask for their \"full form\" are specifically designed to decode or explain these shortened expressions. In this case, \"com\" is likely an acronym (e.g., for \"Communication\" or \"Computer\"), and the query requires a descriptive response that defines it. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) involves questions about specific objects or concepts, but here the focus is on an abbreviation, not a standalone entity.  \n- C02 (human) relates to people or individuals, which is irrelevant here.  \n- C03 (description) could involve explanations, but the specific phrasing \"full form\" targets abbreviations more precisely.  \n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers, which is not applicable.  \n- C05 (location) concerns places, which does not fit.  \nThus, the question's intent is to clarify an abbreviation, making C06 the most appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C06  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly asks for the full form of \"com\", which is a standard query for abbreviations, and the category description aligns perfectly with seeking the meaning of acronyms or shortened forms."

The information requested is not a simple fact like a date or a location, but rather a conceptual or categorical answer about a type of human occupation. The question implies a search for knowledge about professions in general, with a focus on their historical origins, which suggests an interest in human activities and societal development.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a textual response, such as a noun phrase or a short explanation, e.g., \"farming\" or \"medicine,\" or a brief description like \"the oldest profession is often said to be prostitution, dating back to ancient civilizations.\" This format indicates that the answer is not numerical, locational, or focused on a specific abbreviation. Instead, it involves providing information about a human-centric concept, which could include historical context, definitions, or examples tied to human roles.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"oldest\" and \"profession.\" \"Profession\" is a term that inherently refers to an occupation performed by humans, such as jobs, trades, or roles in society. \"Oldest\" adds a historical dimension, suggesting an inquiry into the origins of human activities. Phrases like \"what is\" are common in questions that seek explanations or identifications, but in this context, they point to human-related information because professions are defined by human behavior, culture, and evolution. There are no indicators of numeric, locational, or abbreviation-focused queries, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the oldest profession?\" should be classified under C02 - human because it fundamentally asks about human occupations and their historical significance. A profession is a concept deeply rooted in human society, involving activities performed by individuals for livelihood, such as farming, teaching, or craftsmanship. The question seeks to identify or describe a profession that is considered the oldest, which inherently ties it to human history, culture, and development. For instance, answering this question might involve discussing how professions emerged from human needs, such as survival, trade, or specialization, making it a human-related inquiry. While the question could be interpreted as seeking a description (C03), the core focus is on the human aspect of professions, as they are not abstract entities but are tied to people's lives. This aligns with the C02 category, which encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, rather than purely definitional or numerical ones.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the reasoning aligns with the provided correct label and the question's inherent focus on human occupations."

It is not seeking a specific fact like a definition in isolation but rather a comprehensive explanation or breakdown of the concept. The phrase \"what are\" typically indicates a request for descriptive information, such as what something is, how it works, or its significance. This suggests the question is focused on providing detailed knowledge about the topic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive response, likely including a definition, explanation of what liver enzymes are, their roles in the body, and perhaps examples or related details. It is not a simple numerical value, a yes/no answer, or a list of facts; instead, it requires a narrative or explanatory format. This aligns with categories that demand elaboration rather than concise data points.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what are,\" which is a common interrogative for seeking definitions or explanations. The phrase \"liver enzymes\" refers to a biological concept, but the question is not asking for identification of a specific entity (like \"what is liver enzymes?\"), nor is it focused on a person, number, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it prompts for a detailed description, which is indicated by the word \"are\" implying an explanation or definition. This use of language points strongly to the C03 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what are liver enzymes?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a concept. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek to describe or elaborate on something, such as providing a definition, explaining mechanisms, or offering contextual details. In this case, the question is not requesting a specific entity (C01), human-related information (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation's meaning (C06).

The core information being sought is the name of a person, which implies a human subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is a proper noun, likely a name or a specific reference to a historical or fictional figure. It should be concise and directly identify the person, such as \"Billy the Kid\" or a similar name. The answer format does not involve numbers, dates, locations, or explanations, but rather a straightforward naming of an individual. This suggests the answer is categorical and human-focused.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey phrases include \"name,\" \"scar faced,\" \"bounty hunter,\" and \"old west.\" The word \"name\" directly indicates a request for an identifier, typically of a person. \"Bounty hunter\" refers to a profession associated with human individuals, and \"scar faced\" describes a physical characteristic, which is often used in narratives to identify specific people. The context \"of the old west\" narrows it to a human-centric theme, such as Western folklore or history, where characters like bounty hunters are central. These elements collectively point to a human-related inquiry.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the name of a specific person—a bounty hunter with a scar from the old west. Bounty hunters are roles typically associated with human individuals, and the description \"scar faced\" further emphasizes a personal, human characteristic. The request to \"name\" this individual means the answer must identify a human being, rather than an object, concept, or place. While \"bounty hunter\" could be seen as an entity, the question's focus on naming a particular one shifts it to human identification. This aligns with the C02 category, which covers questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. It does not fit C01 (entity) because entities are broader concepts or things, not specific people; C03 (description) is incorrect as it involves explaining or detailing, not naming; C04 (numeric) is unrelated to numbers; C05 (location) deals with places; and C06 (abbreviation) involves acronyms, which is not present here.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly targets a specific human individual based on the description and context."

The core request is for a precise piece of data that can be expressed numerically, such as a year or a full date.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question is typically a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., \"1948\") or a date (e.g., \"October 2, 1948\"). This format involves numbers, dates, or measurements, which are quantifiable and often used to specify exact times. The answer does not require subjective interpretation, detailed explanation, or other non-numeric forms; it is straightforward and fact-based.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"when\" and \"born.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that often prompts questions about dates, times, or durations, which can be numeric. \"Born\" refers to a specific event with a definable date. These words point to a query that seeks factual, numerical data rather than descriptive, locational, or identity-based information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"when was ozzy osbourne born ?\" directly asks for a birth date, which is a type of measurement or quantity. Dates and years fall under the numeric category (C04) because they involve numerical representations (e.g., day, month, year numbers). While the question references a human (Ozzy Osbourne), the specific focus is on a quantifiable fact about him, not on his identity, life story, or other human-related aspects that would fit under C02. It also does not seek a description, location, or abbreviation, ruling out other categories. The expected answer format reinforces this, as it requires a number or date, aligning with C04's definition of questions asking for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. Therefore, the classification is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a numerical value (date or year) and matches the category's focus on quantifiable information."

In physics, this question relates to concepts like Newton's second law of motion (F = ma) and the effects of gravity and friction. Heavier objects may accelerate faster downhill due to greater gravitational force, but this depends on factors like the coefficient of friction. The question requires a detailed, descriptive answer that breaks down the reasons, such as how mass influences acceleration, rather than providing a single fact, number, or definition. This contrasts with other categories: C01 (entity) would involve identifying objects, C02 (human) would focus on people, C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, C05 (location) would deal with places, and C06 (abbreviation) would seek meanings of acronyms.

Specifically, it appears to be inquiring about a notable individual associated with the New York Yankees, a well-known baseball team. The phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is idiomatic and commonly used in sports contexts to refer to a star player or a figure of great achievement for the team. Therefore, the information being requested is about a specific human being, likely a famous athlete or historical figure from Yankees history.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as a name, or a brief description of a person. Given the context, the response would probably be a specific individual's name (e.g., \"Babe Ruth\" or \"Mickey Mantle\"), as these are common references in discussions about \"the pride of the Yankees.\" The answer does not require a number, date, definition, or other types of information; it is focused on identifying a human subject. The format suggests a direct identification or reference to a person, rather than an explanation or quantitative data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"who\" – This is a direct interrogative pronoun that typically signals a question about a person, aligning with the \"human\" category.\n- Key phrases: \"the pride of the yankees\" – This phrase is culturally and contextually linked to human figures in sports, particularly in baseball. It evokes the idea of a prominent individual who embodies pride or excellence for the team, reinforcing the focus on a person rather than an object, concept, or location.\n- \"yankees\" – While this refers to a sports team (an entity), the question is not about the team itself but about \"who\" (a person) was that pride, shifting the focus to human-related information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"who was the pride of the yankees?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it explicitly asks for information about a person. The word \"who\" is a strong indicator of a human-focused query, as it seeks to identify or describe an individual. In this case, the phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is a metaphorical expression that commonly refers to a famous human being, such as Babe Ruth, who is often called \"the Pride of the Yankees.\" This context confirms that the question is not about an object (C01), a concept or definition (C03), a number or measurement (C04), a place (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is centered on human-related information, specifically identifying a person associated with a team. The expected answer, such as a name or brief description, further supports this classification, as it does not involve quantitative data, spatial details, or acronym meanings.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key words (\"who\" and idiomatic sports reference) clearly point to a human subject, and the context of \"the pride of the yankees\" is universally understood to refer to a person in this domain."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what is considered the costliest disaster the insurance industry has ever faced?\" This is inquiring about a specific event or occurrence that is recognized as the most expensive disaster in terms of insurance losses. The information being requested is the identification of a particular disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or other catastrophic event, rather than a general discussion or list of disasters. It seeks a named or defined entity that fits the description of being the costliest.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely to be a specific name or description of a disaster, such as \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami,\" which are examples of entities. The answer may include details like the name, date, or type of disaster, but it is not expected to be a numerical value, a definition, or a list. The response should be concise and point to a particular thing, as the question is focused on retrieval or identification rather than explanation or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"costliest disaster,\" \"insurance industry,\" and \"ever faced.\" \"Disaster\" is central to the query, and it is modified by \"costliest,\" which specifies a particular instance. This language suggests a search for a specific entity, as it implies the existence of a well-known or recognized disaster that meets the criteria. There are no indicators of human involvement, location, abbreviation, or numeric focus, which helps narrow down the category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing—the costliest disaster from the insurance industry's perspective. An entity in this context refers to a distinct and identifiable event, such as a natural disaster, accident, or other insured catastrophe. The question does not seek a general description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor does it ask for a number, date, or quantity (C04). It also does not focus on a person or human element (C02), a geographical place (C05), or an acronym's meaning (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular disaster, which is an entity, as it is a specific thing that can be referenced by name or description. For example, the answer might be \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The Great East Japan Earthquake,\" both of which are entities in the context of historical events.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly requests a specific disaster, which aligns with the definition of an entity as a particular thing or concept, and the reasoning steps confirm that no other category fits the query's focus on identification and retrieval."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking \"what sprawling U.S. state boasts the most airports?\" This is inquiring about a specific U.S. state that possesses a high number of airports, with the adjective \"sprawling\" providing additional descriptive context. The primary information being requested is the identification of a state, which is a type of geographical entity. The question seeks a name or identifier for a location, rather than a definition, explanation, or numerical value in isolation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a state (e.g., \"California\" or \"Texas\"), as the question begins with \"what,\" which typically prompts a categorical or locative response. The answer may implicitly involve a comparison or quantity (e.g., \"California has the most airports\"), but the core output is the state's name, which is a spatial reference. The answer could include a brief explanation or context due to the \"sprawling\" descriptor, but it is fundamentally a locative response. Characteristics include brevity, as it's a direct question for identification, and potential use of geographical terms.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This explicitly refers to a geographical location within the United States.\n- \"sprawling\": This describes a spatial characteristic, implying size or extent, which is relevant to location-based inquiries.\n- \"boasts the most airports\": This phrase involves a comparison of quantities (e.g., the highest number), but it is subordinate to the identification of the state. It does not directly request a number or date, but rather uses it as context for locating the answer.\n- Overall, the question centers on finding a specific place, with \"location\" being the primary theme.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about a geographical area—the U.S. state. The phrase \"U.S. state\" directly invokes a category of location, and the word \"sprawling\" reinforces the spatial aspect by describing the state's physical extent. While the question mentions \"the most airports,\" which could be interpreted as having a numerical component, the core request is for the identification of the state, not the number itself. Category C05 encompasses questions that seek information about places, including their characteristics or comparisons tied to spatial elements. In contrast:\n- C01 (entity) might apply to broader concepts, but here the focus is specifically on a location rather than a general object or idea.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no mention of people or human activities.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, but this question is not seeking detailed information about airports or states; it's asking for a specific answer.\n- C04 (numeric) could be partially relevant due to the \"most airports\" part, but the question is not primarily about numbers; it's using the numerical aspect to identify a location.\n- C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as there are no abbreviations in the question.\nThus, the classification aligns with C05 because the question is fundamentally about locating a specific place based on its attributes.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's focus on a U.S. state and its spatial characteristics clearly matches the definition of C05, which is for questions about geographical locations."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is: \"what did the only repealed amendment to the u s constitution deal with?\" This phrasing indicates a request for information about the content or subject matter of a specific historical amendment. The focus is on explaining what this amendment addressed, rather than identifying it directly or providing a simple fact. The question is not asking for a definition of the amendment itself but rather for a detailed explanation of its provisions, which suggests it is seeking descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a detailed explanation, definition, or historical account. For instance, the answer might describe the amendment's purpose, key provisions, or context, such as prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages. This format involves providing context and elaboration, rather than a short answer like a date, number, or simple identification. The answer should be informative and explanatory in nature, aligning with a non-numerical and non-factual enumeration style.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what did ... deal with?\" and \"repealed amendment.\" The phrase \"deal with\" is a common indicator for questions seeking descriptions or explanations of topics. Additionally, \"repealed amendment\" refers to a specific historical event, but the question is not focused on identifying the amendment or its number; instead, it asks for its content. This use of language points toward a category that involves explaining or detailing information, which is characteristic of C03 - description. Other categories, like C01 (entity) or C02 (human), might be considered if the question were about a specific object or person, but here the emphasis is on the amendment's subject matter.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question should be classified under C03 - description because it is asking for an explanation or detailed account of what the only repealed amendment dealt with. The 18th Amendment, which was repealed by the 21st Amendment, prohibited the production and sale of alcohol in the United States. The question seeks not just a simple fact (e.g., \"alcohol prohibition\") but a broader description of its implications, historical context, and reasons. This aligns with the C03 category, which covers questions that request explanations, definitions, or detailed information. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about a specific object or concept in isolation; it's about the content of one. It also doesn't fit C02 (human) as no people are central to the query. Numeric (C04) is irrelevant since no numbers or dates are requested. Location (C05) doesn't apply as the question isn't about a place. Abbreviation (C06) is not relevant because the question isn't inquiring about the meaning of an acronym. The core request for descriptive information, such as what the amendment covered, makes C03 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and wording clearly indicate a need for descriptive information, matching the C03 category."

The information being requested is the date, implying a temporal measurement, such as a day, month, and year, or a specific numerical representation of when Boxing Day happens.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a date, which could be expressed in various ways, such as \"December 26\" (for Boxing Day in many countries), \"Dec 26,\" or a full date like \"December 26, 2023.\" This format involves numerical elements (e.g., the day number, month abbreviation or name, and optionally the year).\n- Characteristics of the answer: It is quantitative, as it deals with numbers (e.g., the day of the month, month number, or year), and it may include references to calendar systems. The answer is not descriptive or narrative but rather a factual, numerical response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"date\" – This word is central to the question and directly relates to time or measurement, often involving numbers (e.g., day, month, year).\n- \"boxing day\" – This is a specific entity (C01), but the question is not asking about the entity itself (e.g., its definition or history) but rather about its date. The phrase \"date of\" modifies the query, emphasizing the need for a numerical or temporal answer.\n- Category indicators: The word \"date\" strongly suggests a numeric category, as dates are inherently numerical constructs. Other categories like C03 (description) or C05 (location) do not fit, as the question is not seeking an explanation or a place.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the date of boxing day?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is explicitly asking for a numerical value or measurement related to time. Boxing Day is an event, but the query focuses on its date, which is a specific point in time expressed through numbers. For instance, in many regions, Boxing Day is fixed on December 26, involving the number 26 for the day and 12 for the month (or December). Even if the date varies by country or year, the core request is for a numerical representation, such as a day count or calendar date.\n- This aligns with the definition of C04, which includes questions about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. The expected answer format (e.g., a date string with numbers) reinforces this, as it is not about describing the event (C03), identifying a person (C02), specifying a location (C05), or explaining an abbreviation (C06). The word \"date\" acts as a clear indicator, shifting the focus from the entity \"boxing day\" to its temporal aspect, which is inherently numeric.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly requests a numerical date, and the analysis confirms it fits the C04 category based on key words, expected answer format, and category definitions."

It asks for \"articles of clothing\" that are used as \"tokens.\" Tokens in Monopoly are the physical or symbolic pieces players use to move around the board, such as the car, dog, or other themed pieces. The request is for identifying particular clothing-related items that serve this purpose, implying a need to list or describe these entities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\n- The expected answer format would likely involve listing specific objects or providing details about the clothing articles that are tokens. For example, in some editions of Monopoly, tokens might include items like a penguin suit (which is clothing-themed) or other representations. The answer could be a list, a set of names, or a brief description, but it should focus on concrete, identifiable entities rather than abstract concepts, numbers, or locations.\n- Characteristics: The response is expected to be informative and specific, drawing from knowledge of the game. It does not require a numerical value, a date, or a geographical location, nor does it involve explaining a concept or acronym.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\n- Key words: \"articles of clothing\" – this phrase refers to specific, tangible items or objects, such as hats, coats, or suits.\n- \"are tokens\" – this indicates a relationship to game elements, but the core is about identifying the entities themselves.\n- \"in monopoly\" – this provides context but does not change the nature of the inquiry; it anchors the question to a specific domain.\n- Category indicators: The question uses \"what\" to request identification of particular things, aligning with the \"entity\" category (C01). There are no words suggesting people (e.g., \"who\"), numbers (e.g., \"how many\"), locations (e.g., \"where\"), or abbreviations (e.g., \"what does X mean\").\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\n- The question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for specific objects or concepts that exist within the game of Monopoly. \"Articles of clothing\" are concrete entities—physical items like clothing pieces—and the question seeks to identify which of these are used as tokens. This involves recognizing and naming particular things, such as \"the penguin suit\" or \"the wheelbarrow\" (though the wheelbarrow might not be clothing, the question might be interpreted broadly or in a specific edition where clothing is involved).\n- To determine this, consider the definition of C01: \"Questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things.\" Here, the question is focused on identifying particular entities (clothing items) that have a functional role in the game. It is not asking for a description (C03), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an explanation of an acronym (C06). The key phrase \"what articles of clothing\" directly prompts the retrieval of specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n- For instance, if the answer were \"In some versions of Monopoly, the penguin suit is a token,\" it would still be an entity-based response, as it names a specific object. The question does not require a numerical count or a spatial description, so other categories do not fit.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the classification is correct, as the question clearly requests specific objects or things within a defined context, aligning with the C01 category.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The word \"name\" indicates that the answer should provide the names of these individuals, and \"11 famous martyrs\" specifies the subject matter, which involves people who have been killed or sacrificed for their beliefs, often in historical or religious contexts. This suggests that the question is focused on human beings and their identities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a list of names or a set of references to specific human individuals. For example, the response might include names like \"Saint Stephen\" or \"Oscar Romero,\" along with brief context if needed. The answer does not require numerical calculations, descriptive explanations, or spatial details; instead, it demands the identification of people. The inclusion of \"11\" implies a count, but it does not change the core request for human-related information, as the number is simply specifying the quantity of individuals to be named.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"name,\" \"famous,\" and \"martyrs.\" \"Name\" directly relates to identifying entities, but in this context, it is paired with \"martyrs,\" which is a term referring to human individuals who have been persecuted or killed for their beliefs. \"Famous\" further emphasizes that these are well-known people, reinforcing the human aspect. There are no words indicating a focus on objects (like \"entity\"), places (like \"location\"), definitions (like \"description\"), numbers or quantities beyond identification (like \"numeric\"), or abbreviations (like \"abbreviation\"). This points strongly to the human category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"name 11 famous martyrs\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the identification of specific individuals—martyrs—who are human beings. Category C02 encompasses questions that involve people, their attributes, or human-related information. In this case, the query is not seeking a definition (C03), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires naming human figures, which aligns with the essence of C02. Even though \"martyrs\" can be seen as a concept, it is applied to people, making the question human-centric. The request for \"11\" does not shift the focus to numeric data but rather specifies the number of human individuals to be identified, further supporting the classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly involves identifying specific human individuals and aligns perfectly with the definition of category C02."

It is primarily seeking a human subject, so the response should be concise and focused on identifying the individual.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"who,\" \"inventor,\" and \"silly putty.\" \n- \"Who\" is a pronoun that explicitly directs the question toward human beings or individuals.\n- \"Inventor\" is a role or title associated with people, emphasizing human agency and creation.\n- \"Silly putty\" is the object of interest, but it is not the focus; the question is meta, asking about the human behind it.\nThese keywords align with the C02 category, which is defined for questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, other categories might be indicated by words like \"what\" (for entities), \"how many\" (for numeric), or \"where\" (for location).\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"who was the inventor of silly putty?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking for information about a specific person. The category C02 encompasses questions that inquire about individuals, their roles, or human-related details. In this case:\n- The word \"who\" clearly signals a focus on human identity.\n- \"Inventor\" specifies a human role, as it refers to a person who created something, which falls under human-related information.\n- While \"silly putty\" is an entity (potentially fitting C01), the question is not centered on the object itself but on the human inventor, making it a human-centric query.\n- This contrasts with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about silly putty's properties or definition, e.g., \"what is silly putty?\"\n  - C03 (description) would be for questions seeking detailed explanations, e.g., \"describe the invention of silly putty.\"\n  - C04 (numeric) would involve quantities, e.g., \"how many versions of silly putty exist?\"\n  - C05 (location) would ask about places, e.g., \"where was silly putty invented?\"\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant here, as there is no abbreviation involved.\n- Therefore, the question's primary intent is to identify a person, which aligns perfectly with the C02 category's definition of questions asking about people or human-related information.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly uses \"who\" to inquire about a human individual and focuses on a human role (inventor), which is explicitly covered by the C02 category."

This is a request for a specific golf course located in Myrtle Beach. The core information being sought is the name or identity of a particular golf course, which implies the need to identify or specify an entity. The question does not ask for a general explanation, a quantity, a date, or the meaning of an acronym; it directly seeks a named example of a golf course.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Myrtle Beach Country Club\" or \"The Links at Myrtle Beach\". This format is concise and direct, focusing on the identification of a single entity. It does not require a numerical value, a descriptive paragraph, a date, or an expanded form of an abbreviation. The answer is expected to be a specific reference to an object or concept, aligning with the characteristics of an entity-based response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"golf course\", \"name\", and \"in myrtle beach\". \"Golf course\" refers to a specific object or concept, which is a classic example of an entity. \"Name\" indicates the need to identify or specify something, reinforcing the entity category. \"In myrtle beach\" provides contextual information about the location but does not alter the fundamental request for an entity; it simply narrows the scope to a specific area. These elements collectively point to the category C01, as the question is focused on naming or referencing a particular thing.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"name a golf course in myrtle beach\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific golf course, which is an instance of an entity. An entity category encompasses questions that seek information about particular objects, concepts, or things, such as names of places, items, or organizations. In this case, \"golf course\" is a concrete object, and the phrase \"name a\" directs the response to provide a specific example, like a proper noun. This contrasts with other categories: it is not a description (e.g., asking \"what is a golf course?\"), not numeric (e.g., \"how many golf courses are in Myrtle Beach?\"), not location (e.g., asking about Myrtle Beach itself), and not abbreviation (e.g., \"what does GC stand for?\"). The focus on identifying a golf course as a distinct entity makes C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a specific golf course, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an entity category."

The core request is for geographical information, focusing on the spatial relationship between the bay and the states that enclose it. The question seeks to identify the boundaries or adjacent areas of a particular location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing two state names, such as \"Maryland and Virginia,\" which are proper nouns referring to political entities. The answer is not expected to be a definition, a numerical value, or a detailed explanation. Instead, it should be concise and directly address the spatial aspect of the query. The characteristics of the answer include being specific to geography and involving the identification of locations that are directly related to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"states,\" \"enclose,\" and \"chesapeake bay.\" \"Chesapeake Bay\" is a proper noun that refers to a well-known geographical feature, indicating a location. \"States\" refers to political divisions, but in this context, it is part of the spatial inquiry. \"Enclose\" implies a spatial or geographical relationship, such as boundaries or surrounding areas. These elements point toward a question focused on places or spatial information, aligning with the C05 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"which two states enclose chesapeake bay ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it directly asks about geographical locations and their spatial relationships. The Chesapeake Bay is a specific place, and the query seeks information about the states that border it, which involves identifying spatial enclosures. This fits the C05 category description of \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In contrast, it does not fall under C01 (entity) because while states are entities, the focus here is on their role in relation to a location, not the entities themselves. It is not C02 (human) as no people or human elements are involved. It excludes C03 (description) because the answer does not require an explanation or definition. It is not C04 (numeric) since no numbers or measurements are requested, and it is not C06 (abbreviation) as there is no mention of abbreviations. The question is purely spatial, making C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly focuses on geographical locations and spatial information, which is the core of the C05 category, and the reasoning aligns with the provided category descriptions."

The core request is for a specific numerical value, indicating that the user is seeking a count or measurement rather than a description, definition, or other type of information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question is asking for a \"number\" of points. For example, a typical response might be a specific integer, such as \"300\" for standard bowling, but in this case, it's tailored to fivepin bowling. The answer should be a precise quantity, possibly with units (e.g., \"300 points\"), and it should not involve descriptive text, dates, or other non-numeric elements. The characteristics of the expected answer include being quantifiable and measurable, aligning with the definition of a numeric question.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"points,\" and \"perfect fivepin bowling score.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a direct indicator of a request for a quantity or count, which is central to numeric questions. \"Points\" refers to a unit of measurement in scoring, often numerical in nature. The context \"perfect fivepin bowling score\" provides background but does not change the fundamental request for a number. Other categories, such as description or entity, might involve explaining what points are or what a score entails, but this question is explicitly asking for a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a specific numerical value. The word \"how many\" is a strong signal that the user is seeking a quantity, and the subject matter (points in bowling) is inherently numerical, as scores are measured in discrete units. This is not a question about an entity (e.g., \"What is a fivepin bowling score?\"), a human (e.g., \"Who invented fivepin bowling?\"), a description (e.g., \"Explain how fivepin bowling works?\"), a location (e.g., \"Where is fivepin bowling played?\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"What does PIN stand for in bowling?\"). Instead, it requires a number, making C04 the appropriate classification. The context of a \"perfect score\" implies a fixed or standard quantity, further supporting the numeric nature of the question.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a request for a numerical answer."

The request is for information about an entity (a company) that meets certain criteria, but the way it's phrased implies a need to provide more than just a simple name; it requires contextual or descriptive details to pinpoint the correct company.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a company, such as \"Nintendo\" or \"Sega\", but it may also include a brief explanation or context to justify why that company is the one that sells the \"super system\". For instance, the answer might involve describing the company's role in video game hardware manufacturing and its product lineup. The answer format could be a sentence or phrase that provides a complete response, rather than just a list or a number, indicating that descriptive elements are part of the expected output.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"which company\", \"manufactures\", \"sells\", and \"super system\". These phrases suggest a focus on identifying an organization (an entity) but also imply that the answer requires specifying which one based on its actions and products. The term \"super system\" might refer to a specific product like the Super Nintendo or similar, and the question is framed to seek detailed information about the company in relation to this product, rather than just a direct reference to an object or a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question is classified under C02 (description) because it is not primarily asking for a simple identification of an entity (like C01) or a numerical value (like C04).

The core request is for a number, indicating that the answer will be a digit or a numerical expression, rather than a descriptive or categorical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question uses the phrase \"how many,\" which typically elicits a response like a specific number (e.g., \"There are 16 Community Chest cards in Monopoly\"). The answer may include a brief context or confirmation, but it must primarily be a quantity. Characteristics include: it could be a fixed number (e.g., from game rules), a date (though unlikely here), or a measurement (e.g., count).

The request is not for a specific fact, such as a definition of \"Mormon\" or a list of members, but rather for an explanation or detailed account of what they hold as true. This indicates that the question is seeking interpretive or descriptive information about a concept or belief system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a detailed explanation, such as a breakdown of key beliefs (e.g., the nature of God, salvation through Jesus Christ, the role of scripture, or end-times prophecies). The response should be explanatory and may include definitions or elaborations on concepts, rather than a simple fact, number, or location. For instance, an answer might describe Mormon theology in depth, which aligns with the need for descriptive content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what do mormons believe\", where \"believe\" is a central phrase that signals an inquiry into opinions, doctrines, or explanatory information. \"Mormons\" refers to a religious entity, but the question is not focused on identifying or describing the entity itself (which would be entity-related) but on what they believe, which emphasizes the need for descriptive details.

The core request is for a numerical value or count, indicating that the user wants to know the exact or approximate number of people associated with this linguistic group. This suggests the question is seeking factual, statistical information rather than subjective or descriptive details.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a numerical response, such as a specific number (e.g., \"Approximately 300 million\"), a range (e.g., \"Between 100 and 400 million\"), or a reference to a data source. The characteristics of the answer are quantitative, meaning it deals with measurements, counts, or numerical data. It does not require a narrative, definition, or qualitative explanation, but rather a direct or indirect numerical output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"people,\" and \"speak french.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a strong indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value. \"People\" refers to a human group, but in this context, it is part of the count being sought. \"Speak french\" specifies the subject of the count, but the focus is on the numerical aspect. These elements align with the C04 category, which is defined by questions seeking numbers, dates, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThis question should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity—the number of people who speak French worldwide. The use of \"how many\" directly points to a request for a count or measurement, which is a hallmark of the numeric category. Unlike C01 (entity), which would involve questions about the nature or identity of something (e.g., \"What is French?\"), this question is not seeking a definition or conceptual explanation. It also differs from C02 (human), which focuses on individuals or human-related topics without necessarily requiring a number (e.g., \"Who is the president of France?\"). There is no element of description, location, or abbreviation here; the question is purely quantitative. The expected answer is a number, not a descriptive paragraph or geographical reference, further confirming the C04 classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question unambiguously seeks a numerical answer, matching the core definition of the C04 category."

It is not asking for general information about the statue, but rather a precise measurement in inches that exceeds six feet. The core request is for a quantity, which indicates a focus on numerical data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a numerical value, such as a number followed by a unit (e.g., \"X inches\"), where X represents the exact measurement. This suggests that the answer is quantitative and does not require descriptive, qualitative, or categorical information. The question implies a calculation or direct retrieval of a number, as it involves a comparison (over six feet) and a specific unit (inches).\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how many inches\" and \"over six feet.\" These phrases explicitly reference units of measurement and a request for a count or quantity. \"Inches\" and \"feet\" are standard units for measuring length, which are commonly associated with numeric questions. There are no words indicating a need for descriptive, locational, or human-related information, further supporting a numeric focus.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical answer involving a measurement. It seeks the exact number of inches that the Venus de Milo statue exceeds six feet by, which requires a specific quantity. This is not a question about an entity (C01), as it's not inquiring about the statue itself in a general sense; not about a human (C02), as it doesn't involve people; not about a description (C03), as it doesn't ask for an explanation or definition; not about a location (C05), as it's not concerned with places; and not about an abbreviation (C06), as it doesn't involve acronyms or short forms. The presence of measurement units and the direct request for a number confirm the numeric classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly demands a numerical response, aligning perfectly with the definition of C04."

This type of question focuses on understanding the concept deeply, rather than identifying a particular object, person, number, place, or acronym.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive, explanatory, or definitional response. It could involve providing a detailed explanation, such as breaking down learning into components (e.g., cognitive processes, behavioral changes), referencing educational theories (e.g., constructivism or behaviorism), or offering examples to illustrate the nature of learning. The answer format is likely to be textual and narrative, emphasizing depth and clarity, rather than being numerical, concise, or factual in a simple way.

The phrasing is informal (\"u s state\" likely means \"U.S. state\") and uses \"lived under six flags,\" which may refer to a state's history of being governed by multiple entities, such as European powers or other influences. The core request is to identify a particular state within the United States that fits this criterion. This suggests the question is focused on retrieving a named entity with a geographical and historical context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, specifically the name of a U.S. state (e.g., \"Georgia\" or \"Louisiana\"), as the question begins with \"what U.S. state.\" The answer should be concise and directly identify a location, rather than providing a detailed explanation, definition, or numerical data. The characteristics of the response include being a specific, named place with historical significance, but the primary output is the identification of the state itself, not the description of its history.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This directly refers to a specific entity within the United States, emphasizing a geographical or political boundary.\n- \"lived under six flags\": This phrase introduces a historical or descriptive element, but it is tied to the state's location and its past associations with different flags, which are symbolic representations of control or sovereignty over a place.\n- Overall, the question is inquiring about a place with a particular attribute, but the attribute (\"lived under six flags\") does not change the fundamental request for a location.\n\nThese elements align with categories that deal with places, objects, or concepts. The word \"state\" here is not just any entity but specifically a political division within a country, which is inherently geographical.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a specific geographical area within the United States. The phrase \"U.S. state\" explicitly indicates a location, as U.S. states are defined by their boundaries and are part of the geographical landscape. The additional phrase \"lived under six flags\" adds a historical context, but it does not shift the question away from seeking a place; instead, it specifies a characteristic of that location. \n\n- **Comparison with other categories:**\n  - C01 (entity): While a U.S. state can be considered an entity, the category description focuses on \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" but in this case, the state is being treated as a location rather than a general concept. The question is not about the state as an abstract idea but as a physical and historical place.\n  - C02 (human): This category involves people or human-related information, which is irrelevant here as the question is not about individuals.\n  - C03 (description): This would involve explaining or defining something, but the question is asking for a specific answer (a state name), not a detailed explanation.\n  - C04 (numeric): This requires numbers or quantities, but the question does not ask for a count or measurement; it seeks a named entity.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): This deals with meanings of abbreviations, which is not applicable as the question is not about decoding acronyms.\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a U.S. state, which is a type of location, making C05 the most appropriate category. The historical aspect (\"lived under six flags\") is secondary and does not override the primary focus on the geographical entity.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05\n\nConfidence: High, as the question unambiguously asks for a specific U.S. state, which falls under the location category, and the historical detail does not alter this classification."

This indicates that the user is seeking spatial or geographical information, such as a specific place, address, or coordinates. The information being requested is not about an identity or definition but rather about the physical or conceptual location of the subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a location-based response, such as a place name, address, or descriptive spatial information. For example, answers might include a city, street, landmark, or coordinates. The format is typically concise and factual, focusing on providing a clear position rather than a narrative or numerical value. Characteristics include the use of geographical terms or references, and the answer should directly address the \"where\" aspect without delving into other details like descriptions or definitions.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"where\", which is a strong indicator of location-related inquiries. The phrase \"where is\" is a common interrogative structure used to ask for spatial information. The term \"loop\" is ambiguous and could refer to various concepts (e.g., a programming construct, a physical object, or a geographical feature), but the word \"where\" specifies that the focus is on its location. This aligns with the C05 category, which is defined by questions about places or spatial information, rather than entities, descriptions, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where is the loop ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the position or place of \"the loop\". The word \"where\" is a direct cue for location-based queries, and the structure of the question implies a request for geographical or spatial data. For instance, if \"loop\" refers to a physical loop (e.g., in a park or road), the answer would involve its location; if it's metaphorical, it still seeks where it exists or is situated. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would involve asking what \"loop\" is, not its location.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant as there's no reference to people.\n- C03 (description) would require a detailed explanation, but this question is focused on a specific place.\n- C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, which isn't the case here.\n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding an acronym, but \"loop\" isn't an abbreviation.\nThe key phrase \"where is\" reinforces the location intent, and the absence of other cues (like \"who\", \"what\", or \"define\") confirms that C05 is the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a location inquiry, with no conflicting indicators from other categories."

It involves geographical information, specifically inquiring about a capital city and the associated country. The core request is to identify a place or location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a country (e.g., \"Albania\"), which is a specific entity related to a geographical area. The answer format is concise, typically a single word or short phrase, and does not require numerical data, definitions, or explanations.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nThe key words are \"country\", \"capital\", and \"is tirana\". \"Capital\" refers to a city, which is a defined location, and \"country\" is a nation, also a location. The phrase \"what country's capital\" emphasizes a spatial relationship, pointing to a geographical query. There are no indicators of a person, definition, number, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is seeking information about a geographical place. Specifically, it asks for the country whose capital is Tirana, which involves identifying a location (the country) based on its capital city.

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" is an interrogative phrase that directly asks for an explanation or definition of the term \"titanium.\" Titanium is a specific chemical element, and the question is requesting detailed information about its nature, properties, history, or other descriptive aspects. This indicates that the question is not seeking a simple identification or classification but rather a comprehensive explanation, which aligns with the need for descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a detailed, explanatory response, such as a definition, description of characteristics, historical context, or examples of uses. It would not be a short, factual statement or a single piece of data. For instance, a typical answer might include details like \"Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22, known for its strength, low density, and corrosion resistance.\" This format emphasizes explanation and detail, rather than a numerical value, a location, or a concise definition alone. The characteristics of the expected answer are descriptive, informative, and multi-faceted, fitting the nature of a \"description\" query.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nThe key words in the question are \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to request definitions or explanations. Additionally, \"titanium\" refers to a specific entity (a chemical element), but the question is not focused on identifying it as an entity (C01) or asking about a human-related aspect (C02). There are no indicators of a numeric response (e.g., no mention of numbers or dates), location (e.g., no reference to places), or abbreviation (e.g., no acronym or shortened form). The phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a request for descriptive information, as it prompts an explanation rather than a simple fact retrieval.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly seeks an explanation or definition of titanium, which involves providing detailed information about the subject. Titanium is a chemical element, but the question is not asking for it as an entity (C01), which would focus on its classification or identity, nor is it human-related (C02), numeric (C04), location-based (C05), or abbreviation-focused (C06). Instead, the core intent is to understand what titanium is, implying a need for descriptive content such as its atomic properties, discovery, applications, and significance. This matches the category description for C03, which includes questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed information. The expected answer format, as analyzed in Step 2, is descriptive and explanatory, further supporting this classification. Therefore, based on the question's structure and content, C03 is the appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's wording and intent align closely with the definition and characteristics of category C03."

A caldera is a geological feature, and the question is inquiring into its nature, which requires a descriptive response. This contrasts with other categories: it is not an entity (C01) because while a caldera is a specific thing, the question is not focused on identifying or listing entities; it is seeking a definition. It is not human (C02) as it does not involve people or human elements. It is not numeric (C04) since no numbers or quantities are requested.

The subject \"cushman and wakefield\" appears to be a proper noun, likely referring to a specific entity, but the focus is on their known attributes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format for this question would be a descriptive response, such as an explanation, definition, or detailed account of what \"cushman and wakefield\" is famous for. For example, the answer might include historical context, key services (e.g., in real estate), or reasons for their prominence. This format involves providing a narrative or explanatory text, rather than a simple fact, number, or location. The answer is likely to be multi-faceted and informative, aligning with the need for elaboration rather than brevity.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words and phrases in the question include \"what are ... known for?\" and \"known for.\" These phrases are commonly associated with descriptive inquiries, as they seek explanations of fame, reputation, or defining characteristics. The word \"known\" suggests a focus on recognition or notoriety, which is a hallmark of the \"description\" category. Additionally, \"cushman and wakefield\" could refer to an entity, but the question is not about the entity itself (C01) or its attributes in a literal sense, but about what it is renowned for, which is descriptive.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what are cushman and wakefield known for ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information about the subject's fame or recognition. C03 encompasses questions that seek definitions, explanations, or elaborative details, such as \"what is X known for?\" or \"describe Y.\" In this case, the query is not requesting a specific object (C01), a person or human-related detail (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires a descriptive response that provides context, history, or reasons for the subject's notoriety. For instance, if \"cushman and wakefield\" is a company, the answer might describe its role in the real estate industry, but the question is inherently descriptive in nature, focusing on what they are known for rather than what they are.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C03\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question's structure, key phrases, and expected answer format align closely with the definition of C03, which involves seeking detailed, explanatory information. The use of \"known for\" is a strong indicator of a descriptive query, and there is no ambiguity in the question that would suggest a different category."

The focus is on identifying a particular body of water, such as a sea, ocean, or lake, which is a spatial feature. This indicates that the question is seeking knowledge about a location or place, rather than a general concept, a person, a number, or an abbreviation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or a specific name of a geographical feature, such as \"Black Sea\" or \"Mediterranean Sea\" (though the correct answer is the Black Sea). The answer format is not numerical, explanatory, or definitional; it is a direct reference to a place. This suggests that the question is not asking for a description, a quantity, or a definition, but rather for a specific location.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"body of water\" and \"flow into.\" \"Body of water\" refers to a geographical entity like a sea, ocean, or lake, and \"flow into\" implies a spatial relationship or direction. These words are indicative of location-based inquiries, as they involve spatial positioning and geographical features. There are no words suggesting a need for a number, date, definition, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question belongs to category C05 (location) because it is asking about a geographical or spatial feature. Specifically, it inquires into the destination of the Danube River, which is a body of water, such as the Black Sea. This is a question about a place or location, as it seeks information on where the river terminates, fitting the definition of \"location\" from the category descriptions. While the Danube River itself could be considered an entity (C01), the question is not about the river as a standalone object but about its geographical context and endpoint.

Despite the apparent typos or corrupted text (e.g., \"cd\" might be \"country\", \"nns\" could be \"nations\", and \"nnp\" might be an acronym like \"NNP\" for National Net Product or something similar), the core request is to identify a specific country that was occupied by the Nazis for a certain period, likely indicated by the \"1\" (which could represent a duration, such as 1 year). The question is primarily seeking a geographical location or a specific country name. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" appears to be extraneous or erroneous, but it does not change the fundamental intent of asking about a country. Therefore, the question type is one that asks for a specific place or location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, specifically the name of a country (e.g., \"France\" or \"Poland\"), which is a type of location. It may involve a numerical element if the \"1\" is interpreted as a duration (e.g., \"for 1 year\"), but the primary answer is not a number or date; it's a geographical entity. The answer should be concise, typically a single word or short phrase, and it does not require an explanation or definition, unlike a description-based question. This suggests the answer is categorical and factual, pointing to a specific place.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words in the question include \"country\", which is a direct indicator of a geographical location. Other elements like \"nazis\" (referring to a historical group) and \"occupy\" (implying an action related to a place) support the context of seeking a location. The \"1\" might suggest a quantitative aspect, but it is not the focus; it's likely a modifier specifying the duration of occupation. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" is unclear but does not override the primary intent; if \"cd\" is interpreted as \"country\", it reinforces the location theme. In contrast, words like \"entity\" or \"description\" are absent, and there is no obvious abbreviation or numeric emphasis beyond the \"1\".\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for a specific geographical place (a country) that was occupied by the Nazis. The word \"country\" is a clear indicator of a location, as it refers to a defined territory or nation. The historical context of Nazi occupation involves spatial information, making this a location-based inquiry. While the \"1\" could imply a numeric aspect (e.g., a duration), it is secondary to the main request for a country name. The phrase \"cd nns in nnp nnp nnp\" does not alter the classification, as it either contains errors or is irrelevant to the core question about a location. This aligns with the category description for C05, which includes questions about places, geographical locations, or spatial information. The question does not seek an explanation, definition, or abbreviation, nor is it focused on a human or entity in the primary sense.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly references \"country\" and seeks a specific place, which is unambiguously covered by the location category, despite minor ambiguities in the phrasing."

Specifically, it is requesting the name or nature of something considered \"most valuable\" within the context of the state of Nebraska. The core request is to pinpoint a specific thing or concept associated with Nebraska that holds significant value.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a specific resource. This could be a tangible thing like \"agriculture,\" \"natural resources,\" or \"water,\" or perhaps a category like \"tourism\" or \"minerals.\" The answer is expected to be a noun phrase identifying an *object, concept, or thing*. It does not inherently ask for a quantity, date, definition, or location details, although the *value* aspect might imply a comparison or context.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- \"What is\": This introductory phrase typically seeks identification or definition.\n- \"most valuable resource\": This phrase is central. \"Resource\" is a key noun indicating an object or concept. \"Most valuable\" provides context or a specific attribute the resource possesses, but the core word is still \"resource,\" which points towards an entity. The question is asking *which* entity possesses this attribute within Nebraska.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because its primary objective is to identify a specific *thing* or *concept*. The word \"resource\" directly refers to an entity (something valuable that can be used). The question is asking for the identification of this particular entity (\"what is...?\") that holds the status of being the most valuable within Nebraska.

Therefore, the question type is one that requires a numerical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is a numerical output, such as an integer or a range (e.g., \"There is 1 species\" or \"There are approximately 5-6 species\"). The answer should be quantitative, meaning it deals with numbers, counts, or measurements, and not qualitative details. Characteristics include the use of words like \"how many,\" which signals a demand for a specific value, and the answer should be concise and factual, often derived from data or research. This contrasts with descriptive questions that might require lengthy explanations.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" which is a direct indicator of a quantity or count query. Additionally, \"species\" refers to a biological classification, but the question is not asking for a definition or description of species; it is specifically requesting a numerical attribute. Other phrases like \"of the great white shark\" provide context but do not change the core request for a number. These elements align with the C04 category, which is defined for questions involving numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"how many species of the great white shark are there ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a quantity or count. The phrase \"how many\" is a linguistic marker that directs the response toward a numerical answer, such as a specific number or estimate. This fits the category description for C04, which includes questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. While the subject (\"great white shark\") could fall under C01 (entity) if the question was about its characteristics, the focus here is on the numerical aspect of its classification. No other category fits: C02 (human) involves people, C03 (description) requires explanations, C05 (location) deals with places, and C06 (abbreviation) concerns acronyms. Thus, the question is inherently numeric due to its request for a count.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a numerical quantity, confirming its classification under C04. I am highly confident in this classification, as the key indicators (\"how many\" and the request for a count) are unambiguous and directly match the C04 category.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

It is not simply asking for a definition of what head lice are, but rather seeking an explanation of how they came to exist or spread. This indicates that the question is focused on providing detailed background information, which involves explaining a concept or phenomenon.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as an explanation of the biological or evolutionary origin of head lice, including how they infest humans, their transmission methods, or historical context. This format suggests that the answer is not a simple fact (like a number or location), but rather a narrative or detailed explanation. The answer might include scientific details, making it explanatory in nature, which aligns with categories that require descriptive content.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"origin,\" which implies a request for historical, explanatory, or definitional information, and \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to seek descriptions or definitions. The phrase \"origin of head lice\" points to a need for detailed information about the cause or background of a specific entity (head lice). These elements suggest that the question is not focused on identifying a single fact (like a number or location) but rather on providing a comprehensive explanation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is the origin of head lice?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information about a specific concept. While \"head lice\" refers to an entity (C01), the question specifically targets its origin, which requires a descriptive response rather than a simple identification or fact-based answer. For instance, an answer might involve explaining that head lice are parasitic insects that originated from lice found on other animals and adapted to humans, or how they spread through close contact. This type of inquiry falls under \"description\" as defined by the category, which includes questions seeking explanations, definitions, or detailed information. It does not fit other categories: it's not about a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The focus on \"origin\" emphasizes the need for a descriptive explanation, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question explicitly seeks a descriptive explanation rather than a factual, numerical, locational, or categorical response."

It seeks to identify the particular bird species that was the first to be domesticated by humans. This indicates a request for information about a concrete thing, such as an animal or a specific entity, rather than a general concept, a person, a number, or a location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely to be a specific bird species or a descriptive name, such as \"chicken\" or \"red junglefowl,\" which are examples of entities. The answer format is typically a noun phrase or a short name, representing a distinct object or concept. It does not require a numerical value, a date, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description. The response is expected to be factual and point directly to an entity, without elaboration unless specified.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"first,\" \"domesticated,\" and \"bird.\" \"First\" suggests a question of primacy or sequence, but it does not change the core inquiry. \"Domesticated\" refers to a state or process, but the focus is on the bird itself. \"Bird\" is the central noun, indicating a specific type of animal. There are no words like \"how,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"who,\" or \"abbreviation\" that would point to other categories. The phrase \"what was\" is a standard interrogative for identifying entities, reinforcing that the question is about a particular thing.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what was the first domesticated bird?\" is asking for the identification of a specific bird species, which is a concrete entity. Category C01 (\"entity\") encompasses questions that seek information about specific objects, concepts, or things, such as animals, plants, or other tangible items. In this case, the bird is being treated as a distinct entity with historical significance, and the question is designed to elicit a name or type rather than a description, number, location, or abbreviation.

The key elements are the word \"when,\" which indicates a temporal inquiry, and the subject \"cnn begin broadcasting,\" which refers to an event in the history of a media organization. The information being requested is a date or time-related fact, such as a specific year, month, or day.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a numerical value or a date, such as \"June 1980\" or \"1980.\" This could include a year, month, and day, but the core is a measurement of time. The answer is expected to be factual and concise, often in a numeric form (e.g., a number representing a year or a specific date). It does not require a detailed explanation or narrative, as the focus is on retrieving a precise piece of information.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"when,\" \"begin,\" and \"broadcasting.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that often points to questions about time, dates, or events. \"Begin\" suggests an event with a starting point, and \"broadcasting\" refers to an activity. The phrase \"when did\" is a common structure for questions seeking temporal information. While \"cnn\" is an abbreviation for \"Cable News Network,\" which could relate to the C06 category (abbreviation), the question is not asking for its meaning; it's asking for a fact about its history. This helps rule out categories like C06.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"when did cnn begin broadcasting?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is asking for a specific date or numerical value related to an event. The category C04 encompasses questions that seek numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. In this case, the answer involves a temporal measurement—such as a year or a date—which is fundamentally numerical. For example, CNN began broadcasting on June 1980, and the year \"1980\" is a number, while the full date includes numerical components. \n\nThis classification fits because:\n- The question is not asking for a description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor is it focused on an entity itself (C01), a person (C02), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is directly requesting a fact that can be expressed numerically.\n- The word \"when\" reinforces the temporal aspect, which aligns with the numeric category as dates are a form of measurement.\n- In contrast, if the question were asking for CNN's purpose or details about its founders, it might fall under C03 (description), but here, the focus is on a specific time point.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly seeks a date or numerical value, which is consistent with the C04 category definition."

This could include cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, or temporal expressions like \"centuries\" or \"years.\" The answer is expected to be quantifiable and precise, fitting the nature of a numeric response. It does not require a narrative, definition, or qualitative description, but rather a factual, numerical piece of information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"when,\" which is a temporal indicator often associated with questions seeking dates or times. Additionally, \"flourish\" implies a period of activity or development, which is commonly expressed using numbers (e.g., centuries, decades). There are no words suggesting a focus on entities (like specific objects), humans (individuals or people), descriptions (explanations or definitions), locations (geographical places), or abbreviations (acronyms). This reinforces the idea that the question is seeking numerical information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"when did rococo painting and architecture flourish?\" directly asks for a time period, which is a classic example of a numeric query. Category C04 (numeric) encompasses questions that require numerical answers, including dates, quantities, measurements, or any form of numerical data. In this case, the answer would involve numbers (e.g., the 18th century, specific years like 1715-1775), which aligns perfectly with the definition of C04. \n- To contrast with other categories:\n  - It is not C01 (entity) because the question is not asking about a specific object or concept (e.g., \"what is Rococo?\"), but rather its temporal existence.\n  - It is not C02 (human) because it does not involve people or human figures.\n  - It is not C03 (description) because it does not seek an explanation or definition; it wants a factual time-based answer.\n  - It is not C05 (location) because there is no reference to places or spatial information.\n  - It is not C06 (abbreviation) because the question does not involve decoding or explaining an acronym.\n- Therefore, the question fits neatly into C04 due to its explicit request for a numerical time frame.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Based on the analysis, the question is confidently classified as C04, as it directly seeks numerical information about a historical period.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

This indicates that the core information being sought is related to a human being, as inventions are typically attributed to people. The question does not focus on the makeup itself but on the human inventor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n- The expected answer format is likely to be a proper noun or name of a person, such as \"Cleopatra\" or \"Susan Constantine,\" which are human entities. The answer may involve a single individual or a group, but it will not be a number, date, definition, or location. This suggests that the response is human-centric, emphasizing personal attribution rather than descriptive, quantitative, or spatial details.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n- Key words include \"who,\" which is a pronoun explicitly referring to a person, and \"invented,\" which implies an action performed by a human. The phrase \"make up\" refers to a concept or object, but the question is not about the object's properties or description; instead, it shifts the focus to the human inventor. These elements align with the C02 category, which deals with human-related information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n- The question \"who invented make up ?\" directly asks for information about a person, specifically the inventor. This falls under the C02 category (\"human\") because it seeks human-related information, such as individuals, their roles, or actions. In contrast, it does not fit other categories: C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about the makeup itself or its characteristics; C03 (description) would be for explaining or defining makeup; C04 (numeric) for numbers or dates; C05 (location) for places; and C06 (abbreviation) for acronyms. Here, the focus is on identifying a human, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n- Final classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly uses \"who\" to refer to a person and the context clearly indicates a human inventor, aligning perfectly with the C02 category."

This phrasing suggests a query that requires selecting or identifying a specific individual from a list or set (implied by \"which of the following\") who holds the title of Rhodes Scholar. The Rhodes Scholar is a prestigious award given to students for study at the University of Oxford, and it is inherently tied to human achievements, such as notable figures in various fields who have received this scholarship. The question is not asking for a definition or a general fact but rather for the identification of a person, making it a human-related inquiry.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format involves naming or specifying a person, likely a proper noun (e.g., a name like \"Nelson Mandela\" or \"Bill Gates\"), as the question seeks to determine which individual from a given list was a Rhodes Scholar. This implies that the answer is not a number, date, location, or explanation but rather a reference to a human entity. The answer characteristics include being specific to an individual and potentially involving historical or contemporary figures associated with the Rhodes Scholarship.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"which of the following,\" which indicates a selection task from a predefined list, and \"rhodes scholar,\" which refers to a title or designation for people. The word \"was\" suggests a past or historical context, implying that the question is about identifying a person who has held this status. The term \"Rhodes Scholar\" is not an object, concept, or abbreviation but a human-centric title, aligning with the C02 category for human-related information. Phrases like \"which of the following\" often point to questions about people in multiple-choice scenarios.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"which of the following was rhodes scholar ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly seeks information about a specific individual or person. The Rhodes Scholarship is a human-centric award, and the question is asking which person from a list was honored with it, making it a query about people, individuals, or human-related information. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) could encompass people, but the description specifies \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" and while people are entities, C02 is more precise for questions focused on human identities and achievements.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, such as \"what is a Rhodes Scholar?\", but this question is not seeking a definition; it's asking for identification.\n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers or measurements, which are not relevant here.\n- C05 (location) concerns places or spatial information, absent in this query.\n- C06 (abbreviation) requires the meaning of acronyms, but \"Rhodes Scholar\" is not an abbreviation.\nThe core of the question is to identify a human being, as the Rhodes Scholar title is exclusively for individuals, not things or concepts. This focus on people aligns perfectly with the C02 category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly centered on identifying a person associated with the Rhodes Scholarship, which falls under the \"human\" category. I am highly confident in this classification, as it matches the given correct label and the question's intent.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

It may include details like who founded the team, its key members, and any historical context, but it should not be a simple numerical value, a date, or a location. The answer is expected to provide detailed information, making it explanatory or definitional in nature, rather than factual or quantitative.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases include \"who comprised,\" which directly asks for the composition or makeup of the team, and \"the now defunct comic book team known as the champions,\" which specifies a particular entity but shifts the focus to human-related information. Words like \"comprised\" suggest a need for descriptive details about the individuals, such as their identities and roles, rather than abstract concepts or physical objects. This aligns with categories that involve human elements or detailed explanations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C02 - description).\nThe question falls under category C02, \"description,\" because it is primarily seeking an explanation or detailed account of the team's composition. While the team itself is an entity (which could relate to C01), the specific wording \"who comprised\" emphasizes human elements, such as the individuals who made up the group. This requires a descriptive response that goes beyond simple identification; it involves providing context, such as who these people are, their contributions, or the team's history. For example, the answer might include names like \"Geoff Johns\" or \"Tom King\" if they were involved, along with brief descriptions of their roles. This contrasts with other categories: it's not asking for a number (C04), a location (C05), an abbreviation (C06), or a pure definition of an object (C01), but rather a narrative or explanatory description that involves human aspects.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly requests detailed information about the human components of a specific group, aligning with the definition of a description query."

The information being requested is not just a simple location name but a detailed explanation of how and why the breed originated, including possible geographical, cultural, or historical contexts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a descriptive, explanatory response rather than a short, factual one. For instance, an answer might include details such as the breed's roots in ancient Mexico, references to the Techichi dog, or the process of domestication and evolution. This suggests that the answer will be textual, narrative-driven, and may incorporate elements like dates, places, and historical facts, but the core focus is on providing a comprehensive description.

While \"where\" might suggest a spatial query, the phrase \"come from\" implies a broader inquiry into history, evolution, and context, which falls under the \"description\" category. This category encompasses questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed accounts, such as how something originated or developed. In contrast, C05 - location would be appropriate for a question like \"Where is the breed named 'chihuahua' from?\" if it were focused solely on a geographical pinpoint, but here the question demands a more nuanced response involving historical details.

This is a straightforward inquiry seeking the identity of a specific animal, namely the largest one. The core request is to identify or name the entity in question, which is a type of snake. It is not asking for subjective opinions, personal stories, or other types of information, but rather a factual identification of a particular thing.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a noun or a noun phrase, such as the scientific or common name of the snake species (e.g., \"Reticulated Python\" or \"Green Anaconda\"). The answer may include brief descriptive elements if needed, but it is primarily focused on naming or identifying the entity. It does not require a numerical value, a date, a location, or an explanation of what the snake is; instead, it seeks a direct reference to the specific object. This contrasts with categories like C03 (description), which would expect a detailed explanation, or C04 (numeric), which would require a number.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"largest snake\" and \"in the world\". \"Snake\" is a specific object or thing, falling under the domain of entities. The word \"largest\" indicates a comparative aspect, but it still points to identifying a particular entity rather than asking for a quantity or measurement. The phrase \"what is\" is a common indicator for questions seeking identification or definition, which aligns with C01. There are no words suggesting a human, a location, a number, or an abbreviation, which would point to other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the largest snake in the world ?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for the identification of a specific object or concept—the largest snake. The category C01 is defined as questions that inquire about specific objects, concepts, or things, which directly matches this query. The snake in question is a tangible or conceptual entity, and the question seeks its name or identity, not a description, number, location, or abbreviation. For example, if the question were \"What is the length of the largest snake?\" it would fall under C04 (numeric), but here, it is focused on the entity itself. The use of \"what is\" reinforces the need for identification, and the context (\"in the world\") provides scope but does not alter the core request for an entity. This classification ensures that the answer is about a thing, not a person, place, or abstract concept like a definition.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, I am highly confident that this question should be classified as C01, as it aligns perfectly with the category description for questions about specific objects or things.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

    "text": "how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?",
    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\n\nThe question is: \"how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?\". This is an inquiry about a financial aspect of a legal matter. Specifically, it is asking for the monetary value associated with a back injury lawsuit, such as potential settlements, damages awarded, or costs involved. The information being requested is a numerical amount, indicating that the answer should quantify the financial outcome in some way, like dollars or a comparable unit.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a numerical value, such as a specific dollar amount, a range (e.g., \"between $10,000 and $500,000\"), or an average statistic. It could also include units like \"dollars\" or \"USD\" to provide context. The characteristics of the answer are that it must be measurable and expressible in numbers, rather than being descriptive, categorical, or qualitative. For instance, if the answer were \"it depends on the case,\" it might still involve numbers (e.g., \"cases range from X to Y\"), but the core request is for a quantifiable output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nThe key words and phrases in the question are \"how much money\" and \"back injury lawsuit.\" \"How much money\" is a direct and explicit indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value. \"Back injury lawsuit\" provides context but does not change the core request; it specifies the domain (legal or medical) but the focus remains on the monetary aspect. Other potential keywords include \"get,\" which implies receiving or obtaining a sum, reinforcing the numeric nature. In contrast, there are no words suggesting a description (e.g., \"what is a back injury lawsuit?\"), a location (e.g., \"where does this happen?\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"what does BL stand for?\").\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"how much money does a back injury lawsuit get ?\" should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity related to money. The phrase \"how much money\" is a clear signal that the expected response involves numbers, such as amounts, sums, or statistics. This aligns with the definition of C04, which encompasses questions seeking numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. In this case, the quantity is specifically financial, but the category includes all types of numerical data.\n\n- **Why not other categories?**\n  - **C01 (entity):** This category is for questions about specific objects or concepts, such as \"What is a back injury lawsuit?\" The question here is not asking for information about the lawsuit itself but rather a monetary value, so it doesn't fit.\n  - **C02 (human):** This category involves people or human-related topics, like \"Who was involved in the lawsuit?\" The question focuses on money, not individuals, so it doesn't apply.\n  - **C03 (description):** This category is for explanatory or definitional questions, such as \"Explain back injury lawsuits.\" The question is not seeking a detailed explanation but a specific number, so it doesn't match.\n  - **C05 (location):** This category deals with places or spatial information, like \"Where are back injury lawsuits filed?\" The question is about money, not geography, so it's irrelevant.\n  - **C06 (abbreviation):** This category is for meanings of abbreviations, such as \"What does BL stand for?\" The question has no abbreviations and is not about acronyms, so it doesn't fit.\n\nThe question's focus on \"how much money\" makes it inherently numeric, as the answer would typically involve a numerical figure or range, which is the defining characteristic of C04.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct because the question directly uses the phrase \"how much money,\" which unambiguously requests a numerical quantity, and the context of a lawsuit does not alter this requirement for a numeric response."

    "text": "what ' s the common name for acetylsalicylic acid ?",
    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what ' s the common name for acetylsalicylic acid ?\". This query is seeking an alternative or familiar name for the chemical compound acetylsalicylic acid. The core request is for information about a specific substance, which is a defined entity in the context of chemistry or pharmacology. It is not inquiring about a person, a place, a numerical value, or an abbreviation, but rather about the identity or nomenclature of an object or concept.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a word or phrase, such as \"aspirin\", which is the common name for acetylsalicylic acid. This format suggests a direct response providing a label or identifier for the entity in question. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description; it is concise and factual, focusing on naming or identification. This aligns with categories that deal with specific things or concepts, rather than abstract explanations or measurements.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey phrases in the question include \"what ' s the common name\" and \"for acetylsalicylic acid\". The phrase \"common name\" indicates a request for a synonym or everyday term, which points to a question about an entity's identity. \"Acetylsalicylic acid\" is a specific term referring to a chemical compound, which is an example of an entity. Other potential keywords like \"common name\" might suggest a descriptive element, but in this context, it is directly tied to identifying a thing rather than explaining it. There are no words indicating human involvement, location, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for the common name of a specific chemical substance, acetylsalicylic acid. An entity category encompasses questions about particular objects, concepts, or things, such as chemicals, drugs, or other defined items. Here, acetylsalicylic acid is a concrete entity—a chemical compound with a recognized identity. The question is not seeking a definition, explanation, or description (which would fall under C03), nor is it asking for a number, date, or quantity (C04), a geographical location (C05), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is directly requesting a name or identifier for this entity, which is a typical characteristic of C01 questions. For instance, similar questions might include \"what is the chemical formula for water?\" or \"what is the function of mitochondria?\", both of which classify as entities because they focus on specific things. In this case, the query is straightforwardly about the nomenclature of a chemical entity, reinforcing the classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question clearly targets a specific chemical entity without any ambiguity or overlap with other categories."

This query begins with \"what does\" and includes the word \"mean\", which are key indicators that the user is seeking an explanation or definition. The term \"hoya\" is enclosed in backticks, suggesting it is a specific term, likely an acronym or slang, that needs clarification. The context includes \"georgetown\", which may refer to Georgetown University, implying that \"hoya\" is a term associated with that institution, such as a mascot or nickname. Overall, the question is requesting detailed information about the meaning, usage, or significance of \"hoya\" in this context, rather than a simple fact or data point.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a descriptive response, such as a definition, explanation, or detailed breakdown of what \"hoya\" signifies. For example, the answer might explain that \"Hoya\" is the mascot of Georgetown University, known for its eagle symbolism, or it could provide historical or cultural context. The characteristics of the expected answer include being explanatory, potentially involving examples or background information, and not necessarily numerical or factual in nature. This contrasts with formats that require specific numbers, locations, or concise definitions without elaboration.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what does\" and \"mean\", which are strong signals for a descriptive or explanatory query. The use of backticks around \"hoya\" emphasizes that it is a term being defined or explained, and the reference to \"georgetown\" provides context but does not shift the focus away from seeking meaning. These elements align with the category C03 description, as they indicate a need for detailed information rather than a specific object, person, number, place, or abbreviation alone. There is no direct reference to a number, date, or measurement, nor is it focused on a human or location exclusively.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (description) because it is explicitly asking for an explanation or definition of a term, which falls under the category's scope of \"questions asking for explanations, definitions, or detailed information.\" Here, \"what does ... mean\" is a classic phrasing for seeking descriptive content, such as the meaning, origin, or usage of \"hoya\" in the context of Georgetown. While \"hoya\" could be an abbreviation (potentially related to C06), the question is not directly asking for its expansion or acronym definition; instead, it seeks a broader explanation, making C03 more appropriate. The mention of \"georgetown\" adds context but does not change the core request for descriptive information. This classification aligns with the category description, as opposed to C01 (entity), which would be for questions about specific things like \"what is Georgetown University?\", or C06 (abbreviation), which would be for \"what does Hoya stand for?\".\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct because the question's structure and phrasing clearly indicate a request for descriptive information, which matches the definition of C03, while other categories do not fit due to the absence of numerical, locational, or purely abbreviatory focus."

It may include details about accessibility or specific resources, but the core is the locational aspect.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"where can I find,\" which is a direct indicator of a location-based query. The word \"location\" is implied, and the subject matter (finding a list of books) does not change the category focus. Other elements like \"classic books\" and \"5th and 6th graders\" provide context but do not alter the core request for a place. No words suggest a numeric, descriptive, or abbreviatory need.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the place or source where information can be found, which aligns with the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" The phrase \"where can I find\" is a strong signal for this category, as it seeks spatial or locational details. While the question involves books, it is not about the books as an entity (C01), people (C02), explanation (C03), numbers (C04), or abbreviations (C06).

The core request is for the date or period when this event occurred, which implies a need for temporal information. The question does not seek an explanation, definition, or other details; it is focused on retrieving a factual piece of information related to a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question would typically be a date, year, or numerical value, such as \"February 28, 1789\" or \"in 1789.\" This format involves numbers or specific measurements of time, indicating that the answer is quantitative and precise. Characteristics include the use of numerical data (e.g., years, months, days) or a direct reference to a number, which aligns with the need for a factual, data-driven response rather than descriptive or qualitative information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"when\" and \"take place.\" \"When\" is a direct indicator of a time-related query, often seeking a date or numerical timestamp. \"Take place\" reinforces the idea of an event occurring at a specific time. The phrase \"the bounty mutiny\" refers to a historical event, but the question is not about its nature or description; it is specifically asking for the time of occurrence. No other categories are hinted at, as there are no words suggesting a person, location, description, or abbreviation.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"when did the bounty mutiny take place ?\" falls under category C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical or date-based response. The word \"when\" is a strong signal for time-related queries, and the Bounty mutiny is a well-documented historical event that occurred at a specific time (in this case, in 1789).

It is not asking for a person, a definition, a number, a location, or an abbreviation. Instead, it seeks the name or title of a particular literary work, which is an entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer is likely to be a specific title or name of a novel, such as \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick. This answer is a proper noun or a concept, not a numerical value, a date, a geographical location, or an explanation. The response format is typically a short phrase or sentence naming the entity, without requiring additional details or calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"novel\", which refers to a specific object or concept (a book), and \"inspired\", which indicates a relationship but does not change the core request for an entity. The phrase \"movie bladerunner\" specifies a particular thing (the film), but the question is centered on the novel as the entity in question.

A novel is a tangible or abstract thing, such as a literary work, which fits the definition of an entity. This is not a human-related question (C02), as no individual is mentioned or focused on. It is not a description (C03), since it does not ask for an explanation or definition of the novel or movie. It is not numeric (C04), as it does not seek numbers, dates, or quantities. It is not location-based (C05), as no place is involved. Finally, it is not an abbreviation (C06), as there is no acronym or short form being queried. The question directly requests information about a particular thing, making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question clearly seeks a specific entity (a novel) and aligns with the C01 category definition."

This is a direct inquiry that seeks an explanation or definition of the term \"transistor\". It is not asking for a specific instance, such as a particular transistor device, or a quantity, but rather the conceptual understanding of what a transistor is. The information requested includes details about its function, characteristics, history, or applications, which are all descriptive in nature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a detailed, explanatory response, such as a definition, explanation, or overview of the concept. It may include technical details, examples, or comparisons, but it is not expected to be a single number, date, or short fact. The answer should be narrative in style, providing comprehensive information rather than a concise or numerical output. This aligns with categories that involve descriptive or explanatory content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what is\", which is a common indicator of descriptive questions, as it prompts for definitions or explanations. The term \"transistor\" refers to a specific concept in electronics, but the question is not focused on identifying an entity (like a physical object) or a human-related aspect. There are no numerical indicators (e.g., numbers or dates), location references, or abbreviations present. The phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a request for detailed information, which is characteristic of the description category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is a transistor ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly asks for an explanation or definition of a concept. Transistors are electronic components, and the question seeks detailed information about their nature, operation, and significance, which falls under the description category. This is evident from the use of the phrase \"what is\", which typically indicates a need for elucidation rather than identification of a specific entity, quantity, location, or abbreviation. For instance, if the question were asking for the location of a transistor's invention or a numerical value like its size, it would fit a different category (e.g., C05 or C04). However, here, the focus is on providing a comprehensive description, making C03 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question clearly fits the description category due to its request for explanatory information. I am highly confident in this classification, as it aligns perfectly with the category definitions and the question's intent.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

The core request is for identification and listing of these entities, rather than seeking a numerical value, a definition, or a location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format involves providing a list or description of specific elements, such as \"oxygen, silicon, aluminum, etc.\" This is typically a set of named objects or concepts, which suggests a descriptive or informational response focused on entities. It does not require a numerical output, a date, or a spatial description, but rather a clear identification of what those elements are.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"elements,\" which refers to specific chemical entities, and \"earth ' s crust,\" which is a concept or thing. The phrase \"most common\" indicates a selection or ranking of entities, but the primary action is \"are,\" which seeks to identify or describe these entities. There are no words suggesting human involvement, numerical data, location, or abbreviation, which helps narrow down the category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking about specific objects or concepts—the elements that make up the Earth's crust. Elements are tangible or abstract entities in the context of chemistry, and the question is focused on identifying and listing them, which aligns with the definition of C01. It is not a human-related question (C02), as it does not involve people or individuals. It is not a description question (C03), though it might involve some explanation of what elements are, but the main request is for the entities themselves. It is not numeric (C04), as it does not ask for quantities or measurements (e.g., percentages or ranks). It is not location-based (C05), as it is not inquiring about places or spatial information.

The core request is for a price, which is a quantitative measure, rather than qualitative information about the tent itself.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a numerical value, such as a dollar amount (e.g., \"$40\" or \"approximately $60\"), a range of numbers, or a specific quantity like \"around $50.\" The answer should be a number or a set of numbers, not a descriptive text, definition, or other non-numeric format. This aligns with the nature of cost inquiries, which are inherently quantitative.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"how much,\" which directly implies a request for a quantity or price. The word \"cost\" reinforces this by explicitly referring to a monetary value. Additionally, the phrase \"2 foot square\" provides a measurement, which is numeric, and \"with sides\" adds detail about the tent but does not alter the primary focus on cost. These elements collectively point to a question seeking numerical information, as opposed to descriptive, locational, or other categorical data.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical value—the cost of the tent. Cost is a type of quantity that is typically expressed in numbers, such as currency units (e.g., dollars, euros), and often involves calculations or estimations based on size or features. While the question mentions the tent's dimensions (\"2 foot square\"), this is secondary and provides context for the cost query but does not shift the focus to a descriptive or entity-based question. The category C04 encompasses questions that require numerical answers, including those involving quantities, measurements, or prices. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about the tent itself as an object; C02 (human) is irrelevant as no people are involved; C03 (description) would require an explanation or definition, which is not requested; C05 (location) is unrelated to places; and C06 (abbreviation) does not involve any acronym or initialism. Thus, the primary intent for a numeric response confirms C04.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification, as the question's core request for a cost aligns perfectly with the definition of C04, which involves seeking numerical quantities."

These words align with the \"description\" category, as they indicate a need for detailed, explanatory content rather than a specific type of data like a number or location.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question is asking for the origin of a word, which directly seeks an explanation or definition of its beginnings. This falls under the \"description\" category (C03) because it requires providing detailed information, such as the word's history, etymology, or how it was formed. Unlike a \"numeric\" question that would ask for a quantity or date, or a \"location\" question that would inquire about a place, this question focuses on the word itself and its development, making it descriptive in nature. Even if \"jj\" is an abbreviation, the core inquiry about its origin still fits the description category, as it involves explaining the word's meaning or history rather than just defining it.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High, as the question explicitly asks for the origin, which necessitates a descriptive response, aligning perfectly with the C03 category."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**\nThe question is: \"how many hostages were killed in the entebbe raid?\" This question is requesting a specific quantity or count related to a historical event. The core focus is on obtaining a numerical value, such as the number of hostages killed, rather than seeking detailed information about the event itself, the people involved, or the location. The phrase \"how many\" is a direct indicator that the answer should be a number or a specific measurement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format for this question is numerical. It should be a specific number, such as an integer (e.g., \"39\" or \"approximately 40\"), or possibly a date if the context involved a timeline, but in this case, the question is explicitly about the number killed. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or other formats; it is purely quantitative. This aligns with categories that deal with numerical data, as opposed to qualitative or categorical information.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words in the question include \"how many,\" which is a strong indicator of a numeric question. This phrase is commonly used when seeking quantities, counts, or measurements. Other elements like \"hostages\" and \"entebbe raid\" provide context but do not change the fundamental request for a number. \"Hostages\" could relate to a human or entity category if the question focused on individuals, but here it is used in a quantitative sense. \"Entebbe raid\" refers to a specific event, but the question is not asking for its description, location, or abbreviations; it is focused on the numerical outcome.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question should be classified under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a numerical value. The word \"how many\" is a clear signal that the expected response is a count or quantity, which falls under the numeric category. While the question mentions \"hostages\" (which could imply human-related information) and \"entebbe raid\" (which might suggest a location or event), the primary intent is to obtain a specific number, not to describe people, places, or concepts. This is not a description question because it does not seek an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what was the Entebbe raid?\"). It is not a location question because the focus is on the number killed, not the geographical details. It is not an abbreviation question as there is no acronym or short form involved. Finally, it is not an entity or human question because it is not inquiring about specific objects, concepts, or individuals but rather a quantifiable aspect of an event. Therefore, the question fits squarely into the numeric category.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question explicitly requests a numerical answer, and the category C04 is designed for such queries."

This is an inquiry about methods or strategies to increase one's intelligence quotient (IQ). It is not seeking a specific fact, a numerical value, or a location, but rather an explanation of actions or processes that could lead to raising IQ.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format would involve a descriptive response, such as a list of tips, steps, or explanations of cognitive activities that might improve IQ. For example, the answer might include details on education, brain training exercises, or lifestyle changes. This format is explanatory and non-numeric, focusing on providing detailed information rather than a simple fact or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how\" and \"raise\". \"How\" typically indicates a request for a method, process, or explanation, while \"raise\" suggests an action to increase something. The term \"iq\" refers to a concept (intelligence quotient), which is not an abbreviation, entity, or location. These elements point toward a question that seeks detailed information or a description of a process.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how you can raise your iq ?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation or detailed information on how to achieve a specific outcome. It does not fit other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because it is not inquiring about a specific object or concept like \"what is IQ?\" but rather about how to change it.\n- It is not C02 (human) because, while IQ is related to humans, the question focuses on the method of raising IQ, not on people or individuals.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because there is no request for numbers, dates, or quantities (e.g., \"what is the average IQ?\" or \"what score do you need?\").\n- It is not C05 (location) because there is no reference to places or spatial information.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because \"iq\" is not an acronym or abbreviation being asked to be explained; it is a full term (though often abbreviated, the question does not focus on its meaning).\n\nInstead, the question explicitly uses \"how\" to request a descriptive answer, which aligns with C03, as it seeks to explain or define a process for achieving a goal.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nBased on the analysis, the question is clearly asking for a detailed explanation or description of how to raise IQ, which matches the definition of C03. I am confident in this classification as it logically follows the question's intent and structure.\n\nFinal classification: C03"

This is requesting the meaning or expansion of the term \"inri\", which is presented in uppercase letters, suggesting it is an acronym or abbreviation. The context specifies that it is used on Jesus' cross, but the core request is to define or explain what \"inri\" represents. This indicates a focus on decoding a specific term rather than seeking general knowledge about objects, people, or events.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a concise definition or expansion of the abbreviation, such as providing the full phrase that \"inri\" stands for (e.g., \"Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum\"). The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed narrative, or spatial details. Instead, it is a straightforward explanation that directly addresses the abbreviation's meaning, which aligns with questions seeking clarification of acronyms.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey phrases include \"what does inri stand for\", which is a direct query for the meaning of an abbreviation. The term \"inri\" is capitalized and typically recognized as an acronym, especially in historical or religious contexts like Jesus' cross. The word \"abbreviation\" is not explicitly stated, but the phrasing \"stand for\" is a common indicator for such questions. The context \"when used on jesus ' cross\" provides background but does not alter the fundamental request for abbreviation meaning.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C06 (abbreviation) because it explicitly asks for the meaning of \"inri\", which is an acronym. Acronyms like \"inri\" are formed from initial letters and require expansion to understand their full form. In this case, \"inri\" stands for \"Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum\", a Latin phrase related to the inscription on Jesus' cross. This type of question is not about identifying a specific entity (C01), a person (C02), a detailed description (C03), a number (C04), or a location (C05). Instead, it centers on decoding an abbreviation, which is precisely the focus of C06. The use of \"what does ... stand for\" is a hallmark of abbreviation-related queries, making the classification clear and consistent with the category description.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C06  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly seeks the meaning of an acronym, and the provided context does not introduce elements that would shift it to another category."

The word \"who\" is a key indicator, as it typically requests information about people, groups, or organizations, rather than objects, concepts, or physical locations. This suggests the question is seeking human-related information, such as a company, individual, or human-driven process.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a name, a company, or a descriptive phrase referring to a human or organizational actor. For example, responses might include \"Italian winemakers\" or \"specific brands like Martini & Rossi.\" The answer does not require a numerical value, a date, a detailed explanation, or a location-based description. Instead, it calls for an identification of the producer, which is inherently tied to human or human-like entities (e.g., companies, regions known for human production). This aligns with questions that focus on people or human involvement.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"who,\" \"produces,\" and \"spumante.\" \"Who\" is a pronoun that directly points to human subjects, such as individuals or groups. \"Produces\" is a verb that implies human agency or organizational action, as it describes an activity typically performed by people or entities. \"Spumante\" is the object of the query, but it does not change the core focus on the producer. These words align with the C02 category, which emphasizes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, words like \"what,\" \"where,\" or \"how\" might suggest other categories (e.g., entity or location), but \"who\" specifically narrows it to human elements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who produces spumante?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it directly asks for the producer of a product, which is inherently human-centric. The use of \"who\" indicates a request for information about people, organizations, or human-driven processes, rather than abstract concepts, locations, or numerical data. For instance, if the question were \"what is spumante?\" it might fall under C03 (description), but here, the focus is on the producer. Similarly, if it asked \"where is spumante produced?\" it could be C05 (location), but the word \"who\" shifts the emphasis to the human or organizational actor. This classification fits the category description for C02, which includes questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, as spumante production involves human labor, companies, or regions known for winemaking expertise. The answer would not be a number (C04), a definition (C03), or a place (C05), but rather an entity like a person, company, or group.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question's structure and keywords clearly point to human-related information, and the classification aligns with the provided correct label."

The core request is for the name or names of the individual(s) credited with the discovery of electricity. This implies a focus on human figures, as electricity discovery is commonly associated with specific historical or scientific individuals, such as figures like Benjamin Franklin or Michael Faraday. The question does not seek abstract concepts, objects, or other types of information but rather targets a human subject.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format for this question is likely to be a proper noun or a descriptive phrase identifying a person, such as \"Benjamin Franklin\" or \"a group of scientists.\" It may involve a single name or a brief explanation, but the primary output is human-centric, focusing on an individual or individuals.

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what album put the Beatles on the cover of Time in 1967?\" This is inquiring about a specific musical album that was featured on the cover of the Time magazine in the year 1967. The information being requested is the name or title of that particular album, which is a concrete object or concept related to music. The focus is on identifying a specific thing, rather than asking about people, places, or abstract details.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely to be a specific album title, such as \"The Beatles' 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'\" or a similar name. This answer is a noun phrase or a proper name, indicating a thing or object. It is not expected to be a number, date, or descriptive text, but rather a concise reference to an entity. The answer format suggests a direct identification of an existing item, which aligns with categories that deal with specific objects or concepts.\n\n#### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"album\": This directly refers to a physical or digital collection of music, which is an object or concept.\n- \"Beatles\": While this refers to a human group, the question is not centered on them; it's about the album associated with them.\n- \"cover of Time\": This refers to a publication, but the question is not asking about the publication itself; it's using it as context to identify the album.\n- \"1967\": This is a date, but it's provided as contextual information and not the main focus of the question.\n\nThese elements point to the question seeking a specific thing (the album), which is characteristic of the C01 category (entity). The word \"album\" is a strong indicator, as it denotes a tangible or abstract entity in the context of music.\n\n#### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object or concept—the album that featured the Beatles on the cover of Time magazine in 1967. An entity category encompasses questions that request information about particular things, such as objects, events, or concepts, rather than people, descriptions, numbers, locations, or abbreviations. In this case:\n- The core of the question is the identification of an album, which is a defined entity in the domain of music.\n- The mention of \"Beatles\" and \"Time\" provides context but does not shift the focus to human-related (C02) or location-related (C05) topics. The Beatles are the subject, but the question is not about their biography or attributes; it's about the album.\n- It is not a description (C03) because it doesn't ask for an explanation or definition (e.g., \"what is an album?\").\n- It is not numeric (C04) because while the year \"1967\" is included, the question isn't asking for a number or quantity; it's using it to specify the event.\n- It is not location (C05) as there is no reference to a place or spatial information.\n- It is not abbreviation (C06) since no acronym or shortened form is involved.\n\nThus, the question is seeking a specific entity (the album), making C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n#### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nI am highly confident that the classification is C01, as the question directly asks for a specific album, which aligns with the definition of an entity.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

    "label": "C04",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"what is the busiest air travel season?\" is inquiring about a specific time period or event in air travel characterized by high activity. It seeks to identify the season with the most air traffic, which could involve understanding peak travel times, such as summer or winter holidays. The core request is for a temporal or seasonal designation, but it implies a need for data-driven information to determine the busiest period.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer typically involves a specific season or time frame, such as \"summer\" or \"northern hemisphere winter,\" but it often comes with supporting numerical data. For example, responses might include statistics on passenger numbers, flight counts, or date ranges to justify why one season is busier than others. The answer format could be descriptive (e.g., \"December to March\"), but it frequently incorporates quantitative elements like dates or numbers to provide a complete picture. This aligns with the characteristics of a numeric question, as the busiest season is often determined through measurements of traffic volume.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"busiest,\" which implies high volume or intensity, and \"season,\" which refers to a period. These words suggest a focus on quantifiable aspects, such as comparing numerical data across different seasons to identify the peak one. The phrase \"air travel season\" is a common term in contexts where travel statistics are discussed, often involving numerical metrics like passenger loads or seasonal averages. This points toward a category that deals with numbers or measurements, even if the direct answer is a descriptive term.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what is the busiest air travel season?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it inherently seeks information that is defined or determined by numerical data. While the surface-level request is for a seasonal period, the concept of \"busiest\" relies on quantitative comparisons, such as the number of passengers, flights, or revenue generated during different times of the year. For instance, industry reports often use numerical figures to identify the busiest seasons, like the holiday period with the highest traffic. Even if the answer is a simple season name, the underlying information is frequently numerical, making this a numeric question. The category C04 encompasses questions that ask for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements, and this question fits because it prompts the retrieval or calculation of such data to answer the query accurately.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly relates to quantifiable aspects of air travel demand, which are standard in numeric classifications."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"which Japanese car maker had its biggest percentage of sale in the domestic market?\" This is inquiring about a specific Japanese car manufacturer and the fact that it achieved the highest market share in its home market. The request is not simply for a list or identification of car makers but focuses on a particular event or attribute—namely, the one with the biggest percentage of sales. This indicates that the question is seeking information about a specific instance or detail related to the car maker.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer likely involves naming a specific car maker (e.g., Toyota or Honda) and may include additional details such as the percentage of sales or the year this occurred. However, the primary format is descriptive, as it requires explaining or detailing which car maker fits this criterion. The answer might involve a narrative or factual explanation rather than just a numerical value or a simple entity name. This suggests the answer is not purely numeric but could incorporate quantitative data as part of a broader description.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"which,\" \"Japanese car maker,\" \"biggest percentage of sale,\" and \"domestic market.\"  \n- \"which\" implies a search for a specific entity or fact.  \n- \"Japanese car maker\" refers to an entity (a company), but the question is not defining what a car maker is; it's applying a condition to it.  \n- \"biggest percentage of sale\" involves a comparison and a numerical concept, but it's not the focus; the question is about identifying the car maker that achieved this.  \n- \"domestic market\" provides context but does not shift the category toward location-focused questions.  \nThese keywords point to a question that seeks detailed information about a particular achievement or event, rather than just a definition, number, or location.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a specific fact related to Japanese car makers. While it involves identifying an entity (a car maker), the core request is not to define what a car maker is (which would be C01) but to describe which one had the highest market share, potentially requiring contextual details such as historical data, comparisons, or reasons behind the achievement. This aligns with the C02 category description, which includes questions that seek explanations or detailed information. For example, answering this question might involve stating the car maker and providing the percentage or timeframe, making it descriptive rather than purely identifying or numeric. It does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not about the general concept of car makers; it's about a specific instance. It also doesn't fit C04 (numeric) because while numbers might be involved, the primary focus is on the descriptive aspect of \"which\" car maker. The question is not about people (C02 human), locations (C05 location), or abbreviations (C06 abbreviation), as there is no human element, spatial focus, or acronym involved.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly seeks detailed information about a specific achievement, which is characteristic of the description category."

This is a direct inquiry about a specific individual holding a position of authority in a given location. The core request is for information about a person, namely the current or relevant mayor, which implies seeking details such as their name, role, or background. The mention of \"Marbella\" provides context by specifying the location, but the primary focus is on identifying a human being rather than an object, concept, or other entity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer typically involves a proper noun or a descriptive phrase referring to a human individual. For instance, a response might be \"The mayor of Marbella is [Name]\" or a brief description of the person. The answer format is not numerical, explanatory in detail, or focused on a place; instead, it is centered on human-related information, such as names, titles, or personal attributes. This suggests the answer will be concise and directly tied to a person, rather than requiring calculations, definitions, or spatial data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words in the question are \"who\", \"mayor\", and \"Marbella\". \"Who\" is a pronoun specifically used to ask about people or entities, but in this context, it strongly points to human-related information. \"Mayor\" is a title that denotes a human position of authority, further emphasizing the focus on individuals. \"Marbella\" is a geographical location, but it serves as a modifier that specifies the context without shifting the question's primary intent. These elements collectively indicate that the question is seeking information about a person, aligning with the C02 category for human-related inquiries.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"who is the mayor of marbella ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking about a specific individual or human being. The word \"who\" directly queries for personal identity, and \"mayor\" refers to a human role, making the question centered on people rather than objects, concepts, or places. While \"Marbella\" is a location, it does not change the classification, as the question is not primarily about the place itself (which would be C05) but about the human associated with it. This aligns with the C02 category description: questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, other categories do not fit: C01 (entity) is broader and could include people, but C02 is the more precise category for human-focused questions; C03 (description) involves explanations, which is not the case here; C04 (numeric) deals with numbers, absent in this query; and C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant as no abbreviations are present. Thus, the question is clearly human-oriented.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nBased on the analysis, the question is confidently classified under C02, as it directly seeks information about a person, with high confidence due to the clear use of \"who\" and the human-centric nature of the query.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

The core request is for a temporal piece of information—specifically, the year when she assumed the position of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The question focuses on an event in her life, but the essential information being sought is a numerical value representing a point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer to this question is a numerical value, such as a four-digit year (e.g., 1979). It is likely to be a simple, precise number or a range, but in this context, it is typically a single year. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or qualitative details; it is straightforward and quantitative. This aligns with questions that demand factual data, often found in databases or historical records, where the response is a number rather than a narrative.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nThe question contains several key words and phrases that directly point to the category:\n\n- \"year\": This word explicitly indicates a temporal concept, which falls under numeric information, as years are numerical representations of time.\n- \"become prime minister\": This phrase describes an event, but it is not the focus; the question is specifically asking for the year of this event, which is a numerical attribute.\n- \"thatcher\": This is a proper noun referring to a person, but the question is not centered on the person themselves (which would fit C02 - human) or their description (C03 - description). Instead, it is querying a specific fact about them.\n\nOther categories do not fit:\n- C01 (entity) involves objects or concepts, but the question is not about defining or identifying an entity.\n- C02 (human) would be appropriate if the question was about Margaret Thatcher herself, such as \"Who is Margaret Thatcher?\" or \"What are her achievements?\" but here, the focus is on the year.\n- C03 (description) requires detailed explanations or definitions, which is not the case here.\n- C05 (location) involves geographical places, which is irrelevant.\n- C06 (abbreviation) deals with acronyms or shortened forms, which is not present.\n\nThe presence of \"year\" strongly suggests a numeric category, as it implies a request for a number.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question \"in what year did thatcher become prime minister ?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical value. The word \"year\" directly indicates that the answer is expected to be a number, specifically a date in the Gregorian calendar. This type of question seeks quantitative information, such as a specific year, which is a common example of a numeric query. \n\nIn contrast, other categories do not align:\n- C01 (entity) is for questions about objects or concepts, like \"What is climate change?\" but this question is not asking for a definition or explanation.\n- C02 (human) is for questions about people, such as \"Who was the first female president?\" but while \"thatcher\" refers to a human, the question is not about her identity or life story; it's about a specific event in time.\n- C03 (description) involves detailed information or explanations, like \"Describe the Industrial Revolution,\" but this question expects a concise numerical answer.\n- C05 (location) is for spatial information, such as \"Where is the Eiffel Tower?\" which is not relevant.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is for meanings of acronyms, like \"What does AI stand for?\" which is absent here.\n\nThe question's structure—asking for a \"year\"—makes it clear that the response will be a number, fitting the C04 category perfectly. This classification is based on the standard definition of numeric questions, which include inquiries about dates, years, or other numerical data.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the question belongs to category C04, as the explicit request for a year ensures a numerical answer, and the analysis of key words and question type confirms this classification.\n\nFinal classification: C04"

It is requesting a numerical value that represents the duration of the moon's orbital period around Earth, measured in months. The core of the question is to obtain a count or measurement, rather than to identify a concept, explain a definition, or discuss a location.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a numerical value, such as a number followed by a unit (e.g., \"about 27 days\" or \"one month,\" though the latter might be approximate). The question specifies \"months,\" so the answer should be in terms of a quantity that can be counted or measured. This suggests a response that is quantitative, possibly involving a specific number, a range, or a calculation. The answer does not require descriptive text, explanations, or other non-numeric elements, as the focus is on providing a precise or approximate numerical figure.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"how many\": This is a direct interrogative that typically signals a request for a numerical count or quantity.\n- \"months\": This is a unit of time, which is a measurable quantity and reinforces the need for a numerical answer.\n- \"does it take\": This phrase is commonly used in questions about time, duration, or measurements.\n- \"revolve around the earth\": This describes a scientific or astronomical concept, but it does not change the fundamental request for a numerical value; it simply provides context for what the quantity represents.\n\nThese elements collectively point toward a category that involves seeking numerical information, as opposed to other types like definitions or locations.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"how many months does it take the moon to revolve around the earth?\" should be classified under category C04 - numeric because it explicitly asks for a numerical value related to a measurement or quantity. The word \"how many\" is a strong indicator of a numeric question, as it directly seeks a count or numerical estimate. Additionally, the unit \"months\" specifies that the answer must be in terms of time, which is a common type of measurement in numeric questions. The question does not ask for an explanation, definition, or description of the moon's revolution; it is purely seeking a number. \n\nIn contrast:\n- It does not fit C01 (entity) because while it mentions the moon and Earth, it is not asking about their nature or identity but rather a property (orbital period).\n- It does not fit C02 (human) as there is no reference to people or human activities.\n- It does not fit C03 (description) because it is not requesting an explanation or detailed information; it is focused on a specific numerical answer.\n- It does not fit C05 (location) as it is not about places or spatial coordinates.\n- It does not fit C06 (abbreviation) as there are no abbreviations or acronyms involved.\n\nTherefore, the question aligns perfectly with the definition of C04 - numeric, which encompasses inquiries about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the clear request for a numerical quantity and the absence of any indicators for other categories."

    "cot": "\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Question Classification\n\n**Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.**  \nThe question is: \"who sings the themes for ` ` dawson ' s creek ' ' and ` ` felicity ' ' ?\" This query is asking about the performers of specific musical themes associated with two television shows, \"Dawson's Creek\" and \"Felicity\". The key phrase \"who sings\" indicates a request for information about individuals or groups of people involved in singing. The question is focused on identifying human agents (the singers) rather than the themes themselves or other attributes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves naming specific people or entities (e.g., individual singers, bands, or voice actors). For instance, the response might include names like \"John Doe\" or \"The Show Theme Band\". This suggests a direct reference to human-related information, such as names, roles, or credentials, rather than numerical data, definitions, or explanations. The answer does not require a quantity, date, or detailed explanation, but simply identifies the human performers.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe phrase \"who sings\" is a direct indicator of a human-related query, as it specifically asks for information about people. Other key elements include the mention of TV shows, but these are contextual and serve as the subject of the inquiry. The double backticks around the show names might be a formatting error, but they do not change the core intent of the question, which remains focused on the singers. No words or phrases suggest categories like numbers, locations, abbreviations, or descriptions.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for information about people. The word \"who\" directly points to a query about individuals or groups, and the context involves musical performances by humans. While the TV shows mentioned (\"Dawson's Creek\" and \"Felicity\") are entities (which could fall under C01), the question is not about the shows themselves but about the human actors involved in singing their themes. This aligns with the C02 category description: \"Questions asking about people, individuals, or human-related information.\" \n\n- It is not C01 (entity) because the focus is on the people (singers) rather than the shows or themes as objects or concepts.\n- It is not C03 (description) because the question does not seek an explanation or definition; it asks for specific identities.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numerical data (e.g., song counts or dates) is requested.\n- It is not C05 (location) because no geographical or spatial information is involved.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because no abbreviations are mentioned or inquired about.\n\nThus, the question is clearly human-centric, making C02 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question directly seeks information about individuals based on the use of \"who\" and the context of musical performances.\n\nFinal classification: C02"

    "label": "C02",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"who directed ` ` jaws ' ' ?\" This is an inquiry about the creator or performer of an action related to a specific entity. Specifically, it is asking for the identity of the person who directed the movie \"Jaws\". The information requested is the name or details of a human individual, as \"who\" typically refers to a person. The query includes the movie title in quotes, which provides context that the question is about a human role in a creative work.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or name, such as \"Steven Spielberg\", which represents a human individual. The answer could be a single name, a title (e.g., \"the director\"), or a brief description, but it will always refer to a person. Characteristics of the response include being human-centric, potentially involving a specific individual or group, and not requiring numerical data, definitions, or spatial details. The answer is straightforward and does not involve calculations, dates, or explanations beyond identifying a person.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"who\", which is a direct indicator of a human-related query, as it specifically seeks information about a person. The phrase \"directed\" is a verb that describes an action performed by a human, further emphasizing the human element. The quoted \"jaws\" refers to a well-known film, but the question is not about the film itself (which might fall under an entity category) but about the human involved in its creation. Other phrases like the double quotes might be formatting, but they do not change the core intent of asking about a person. These elements collectively point to the C02 category, which focuses on human-related information.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"who directed ` ` jaws ' ' ?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for information about a person. The word \"who\" is a pronoun that denotes a human subject, and \"directed\" is an action typically performed by individuals in a professional capacity, such as in film or media. The context of the movie \"Jaws\" is incidental; the core of the question is to identify a specific human (e.g., the director) rather than the movie as an object or concept. This aligns with the C02 category description: questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, it does not fit other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about \"what is Jaws?\" or \"describe Jaws,\" focusing on the film itself as an entity.\n- C03 (description) is for explanatory or definitional queries, which is not the case here.\n- C04 (numeric) involves numbers, which are not requested.\n- C05 (location) deals with places, irrelevant here.\n- C06 (abbreviation) concerns acronyms, not applicable. \nThus, the question is centered on human identity and action, making C02 the correct classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly asks for a human individual's identity, matching the C02 category definition precisely."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking for the specific Indian tribe that is in conflict with F troop. It seeks to identify a particular group, which is likely a historical, cultural, or military reference. The core request is for information about an Indian tribe, implying a need to name or describe the tribe.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun or descriptive phrase naming an Indian tribe, such as \"Apache\" or \"Sioux\". This could be a simple name or a more detailed explanation, but the format suggests a direct identification. The answer is not numerical, descriptive in the sense of an explanation, or focused on a location; instead, it points to a human group.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases include \"Indian tribe\" and \"doing battle with\". \"Indian tribe\" refers to a group of people, which is inherently human-related. \"F troop\" likely denotes a military unit, adding a human element. The phrase \"perpetually doing battle with\" emphasizes ongoing conflict, which is a human activity. These elements suggest the question is centered on human groups and their interactions.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is inquiring about an Indian tribe, which is a group of people or human community. Although tribes can be seen as entities (C01), the focus here is on the human aspect—specifically, the people involved in the conflict. The category C02 encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, and this query directly seeks information about a human group in a battle scenario. The word \"tribe\" implies a collective of humans, and the context of \"doing battle with\" reinforces the human element, making C02 the appropriate classification. In contrast, C01 would be for questions about non-human entities, but a tribe is fundamentally human.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly centers on a human group and its activities, aligning with the C02 category."

It is not simply asking for a definition or identification but seeks an explanation of how and where this dish originated, which implies a need for detailed contextual information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as an explanation of the dish's history, cultural influences, or development over time. It may include elements like dates, places, or people, but the core format is narrative or explanatory, focusing on providing a comprehensive overview rather than a simple fact, number, or location name.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases like \"where did...come from?\" and \"origin\" suggest a search for historical or descriptive information. The term \"Indian pudding\" refers to a specific entity (a food), but the question is not about identifying it as an object or thing (C01) but about its background, which aligns with descriptive inquiries. Words like \"come from\" imply a need for an explanation rather than a direct location or numeric detail.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category (C03 - description).\nThe question \"where did Indian pudding come from?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about the origin of the dish. This involves providing a narrative that may cover historical context, cultural evolution, and possibly how it spread or was influenced by various factors. For instance, a response might describe how Indian pudding, which is a type of dessert, originated in colonial America with influences from Native American or European traditions, making it a descriptive query. While the question could indirectly involve location (C05) or even human elements (C02), the primary intent is to seek a detailed account, not a specific place or person. This contrasts with C01 (entity), which would focus on identifying the pudding itself, C04 (numeric), which would require numbers, C05 (location), which would ask for a specific place, and C06 (abbreviation), which would deal with acronyms. Thus, the descriptive nature of the question aligns perfectly with C03.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's intent and the category definitions."

It directly references a person, Maurizio Pellegrin, but the core request is for the geographical location where that person resides. The question type is seeking a factual, specific answer related to a place, rather than an explanation or definition.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as \"Rome\" or \"London\", representing a city name. It is a concise, direct response without any need for elaboration, calculation, or contextual details. The answer format is typically a single word or a short phrase, indicating a specific entity or location. This suggests the question is not seeking descriptive or numerical data, but rather a pinpoint piece of information about a spatial reference.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words in the question include \"city\" and \"lives in\". \"City\" is a clear indicator of a geographical location, as it refers to a specific place within a broader context. \"Lives in\" implies a spatial relationship, further emphasizing the focus on location. The mention of \"maurizio pellegrin\" (a human name) provides context but does not shift the primary intent; the question is not about the person themselves but about the place associated with them. These elements align with the \"location\" category, which involves spatial or geographical inquiries.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a geographical place. While the question mentions a human (Maurizio Pellegrin), the central request is for the name of a city, which falls under the definition of \"location\" as per the category description: \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\"\n- To determine this, consider the alternatives:\n  - C01 (entity): This category could encompass cities as objects or concepts, but the question's focus is specifically on the spatial aspect (where someone lives), making \"location\" a more precise fit.\n  - C02 (human): This category is for questions about people or human-related information, but here, the question is not centered on Maurizio Pellegrin; it's using him as a reference to ask about a place. The primary information sought is not biographical or human-centric.\n  - C03 (description): This would involve explanations or definitions, but the question is straightforward and seeks a direct name, not a detailed account.\n  - C04 (numeric): No numbers, dates, or quantities are involved, so this doesn't apply.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): There are no abbreviations or acronyms in the question.\n- The key phrase \"city\" directly points to a location, and the structure of the question (\"what is the name of...\") is typical for seeking specific spatial information. This classification ensures that questions about places are grouped correctly, distinguishing them from broader entity or human-focused inquiries.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C05\n- Confidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly targets a geographical location, and the reasoning based on key words, expected answer format, and category definitions consistently aligns with C05."

The answer may involve additional context if the name is not immediately known, but the core response is the name itself.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey phrases include \"what is the name\" and \"managing director.\" \"What is the name\" suggests a request for identification, often tied to a specific entity or person. \"Managing director\" is a human role, referring to an individual in a leadership position. The term \"apricot computer\" may refer to an entity (e.g., a company), but the question is centered on the human aspect of that entity. These keywords align with human-related inquiries, as they focus on people rather broadly on things or places.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is asking for information about a specific person—the managing director of Apricot Computer. While \"Apricot Computer\" could be considered an entity, the question is not seeking details about the company itself (which would fall under C01, entity), nor is it asking for a description, definition, number, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it directly targets human-related information by inquiring about an individual's name and role.

The category C02 is designed for questions about people, individuals, or human-related topics, making this classification appropriate.

Instead, it is requesting an explanation of the cause or rationale behind the association between horseshoes and luck, which involves cultural, historical, or superstitious context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format for this question is descriptive. It should provide a detailed explanation, potentially including origins, beliefs, or reasons why horseshoes are thought to bring good luck. This could involve historical anecdotes, folklore, or logical reasoning, but it should not be a simple fact, number, or abbreviation. The answer is likely to be narrative or explanatory in nature, focusing on the \"why\" aspect, rather than a concise definition or numerical value.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"why,\" which is a strong indicator of a question seeking an explanation or reason.

Instead, it requires a detailed explanation or step-by-step guidance on how to execute this action, which involves social etiquette, communication techniques, or psychological considerations. This indicates that the question is focused on describing a procedure or providing advice.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a series of steps, tips, or a narrative explanation. For example, the answer might cover topics like choosing the right time, opening lines, handling rejection, or cultural norms. It is not expected to be a simple yes/no, a numerical value, or a direct reference to an entity or location. The answer format is inherently explanatory, emphasizing detail and context, which aligns with categories that involve providing information rather than just facts.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how do you,\" which is a common phrase for questions seeking instructions or explanations. Additionally, phrases like \"ask a total stranger out on a date\" highlight a process-oriented inquiry. These words suggest that the question is not about identifying a specific thing (like an object or person) or a quantity, but rather about breaking down and describing an action. This contrasts with categories like C01 (entity) or C04 (numeric), which would involve direct references to objects or numbers.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information on how to perform a specific task. The core of the question is to understand the process of asking someone out, which requires a descriptive response that elaborates on methods, considerations, and potential outcomes. This is distinct from other categories:\n- It is not C01 (entity) because it is not asking about a specific object or concept (e.g., \"what is a date?\").\n- It is not C02 (human) because while the topic involves human interactions, the question is not focused on people or individuals; instead, it is about the action itself.\n- It is not C04 (numeric) because no numbers, dates, or quantities are requested (e.g., \"how many dates should you ask for?\").\n- It is not C05 (location) because it does not involve places or spatial information.\n- It is not C06 (abbreviation) because there is no mention of abbreviations or acronyms.\nThe descriptive nature of the question, with its focus on providing a step-by-step or explanatory answer, directly matches the definition of C03, which covers questions seeking detailed information or explanations.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C03  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis, as the question clearly requests a descriptive explanation of a process, aligning with the category's focus on providing detailed information."

    "text": "what weapon is the mythological character apollo most proficient with ?",
    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what weapon is the mythological character apollo most proficient with?\" It is inquiring about a specific object or item associated with Apollo, a figure from mythology. The information requested is the name or identity of the weapon, which is a particular thing in the context of mythological lore. This suggests the question is seeking a specific entity, rather than a person, event, or abstract concept.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer is likely a noun or a short phrase naming the weapon, such as \"bow\" or \"arrow,\" based on common knowledge of Apollo's attributes in mythology. The answer format is factual and specific, focusing on an object or concept, without requiring numerical data, descriptive text, or other categories like dates or locations. This indicates a straightforward identification of an entity.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words include \"weapon,\" which refers to a tangible object, and \"mythological character,\" which points to a specific concept or thing in a cultural or historical context. The phrase \"most proficient with\" implies a query for a particular item associated with Apollo. These elements align with the C01 category, as they involve asking about a specific object or thing, rather than a human, description, number, location, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question is centered on identifying a specific weapon from mythology, which is an object (e.g., Apollo's bow or arrows). This falls under the C01 category (\"entity\") because it asks about a particular thing or concept, not a person, event, or abstract idea. While Apollo is a human-like figure, the question is not about him but about the weapon he is proficient with, making it an entity-focused query. There is no indication of a numeric value, location, or abbreviation, and the answer does not require a descriptive or explanatory format. Thus, the question fits C01 as it seeks a specific object in a mythological context.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's focus on a specific object (weapon) within a mythological framework."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question \"what country do the galapagos islands belong to ?\" is inquiring about the specific country associated with the Galapagos Islands. It is seeking factual information about a geographical affiliation, which indicates a query related to places or locations. The question does not focus on defining a concept, describing something in detail, providing a number, or explaining an abbreviation; instead, it is directly asking for the name of the country that claims jurisdiction or ownership over these islands.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer to this question is likely a proper noun, such as \"Ecuador,\" which is the name of a country. The response is typically a short, specific piece of information, often a single word or a brief phrase, rather than a numerical value, a descriptive paragraph, or a list. This suggests that the answer is categorical and factual, aligning with a classification that involves spatial or geographical data.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"country,\" \"galapagos islands,\" and \"belong to.\" \"Country\" refers to a nation-state, which is a type of location. \"Galapagos Islands\" is a specific set of islands, which are geographical features. \"Belong to\" implies a relationship of ownership or affiliation, often tied to political or spatial boundaries. These elements collectively point to a question about geographical locations, as they involve identifying where something is situated in the world.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what country do the galapagos islands belong to ?\" falls under category C05 (location) because it is explicitly asking about a geographical location and its affiliation with a country. The Galapagos Islands are a well-known archipelago, and the query seeks to determine which country they are part of, which is a spatial or geographical inquiry. Category C05 encompasses questions that deal with places, such as cities, countries, islands, or other physical locations, and their attributes. In contrast:\n- C01 (entity) might apply to broader concepts, but this question is specifically tied to a location rather than a general thing.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as no people are mentioned or implied.\n- C03 (description) is not applicable, as the question does not request an explanation or definition.\n- C04 (numeric) does not fit, since no numbers, dates, or quantities are involved.\n- C06 (abbreviation) is unrelated, as there is no mention of an acronym or shortened form.\nThus, the focus on identifying a country and the geographical nature of the query clearly aligns with C05.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident that this classification is correct based on the analysis of the question's content and the provided category definitions."
