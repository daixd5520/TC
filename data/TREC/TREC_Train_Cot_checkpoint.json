    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question is: \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" This query is seeking information about specific movies that include or portray the character named \"Popeye Doyle.\" The core request is to identify or list films, which are media entities, and associate them with a particular character. The question is not focused on a single piece of information but rather on retrieving a set of related items, indicating a search for specific objects or concepts in the domain of film and entertainment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format would likely involve a list of film titles, a description of the films, or a set of facts about which movies feature the character. For example, the response might include names like \"The French Connection\" or other films where Popeye Doyle appears. The answer does not require a numerical value, a detailed explanation, or a spatial description. Instead, it anticipates a response that identifies or references specific entities (films) and their relationship to the character. This suggests an answer format that is informative but not purely descriptive, numeric, or location-based.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"films,\" \"featured,\" and \"character Popeye Doyle.\" \"Films\" refers to specific objects or concepts in the context of cinema. \"Featured\" implies association or inclusion, indicating a search for entities that contain or relate to the character. \"Character Popeye Doyle\" is a proper noun that denotes a specific entity, likely a fictional character from media. These terms point to a query about identifying particular things (films) that are connected to a given concept (character), which aligns with the definition of an \"entity\" category. There are no indicators of human focus, description, numeric data, location, or abbreviation in the question.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what films featured the character popeye doyle?\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking about specific objects, concepts, or things in the context of film and media. The term \"films\" refers to tangible or conceptual entities (e.g., movies as cultural artifacts), and \"character Popeye Doyle\" is a specific entity within that domain. The question is inquiring about the films that include this character, which means it is seeking information about the relationships and instances of these entities. This does not fit C02 (human), as it is not directly about a person or individual; while the character might be portrayed by a human, the focus is on the film and character entities themselves. It also does not align with C03 (description), as it is not requesting an explanation or definition of the character or films. There is no need for numeric data (C04), location information (C05), or abbreviation meaning (C06). The question centers on identifying specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly asks about specific objects (films) and concepts (character) without any elements that would suggest other categories, such as human focus, description, or numeric requirements."

It is not seeking a direct fact or a single piece of data but rather a step-by-step guide or explanation on how to access or compile such a list. The information requested pertains to the procedure for finding the list, which involves understanding how to search for or retrieve data related to celebrities' real names.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer to this question would likely be descriptive in nature, providing an explanation, steps, or advice on how to find the list. For instance, a response might include suggestions like using search engines, checking databases, or explaining the concept of real names versus stage names. The answer format could involve bullet points, paragraphs, or a combination of instructions and context, but it should not be a simple numerical value, a location, or a definition of a term. The characteristics of the expected answer are explanatory and procedural, focusing on detailing the process rather than stating a fact.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how can i find,\" which explicitly requests a method or explanation, and \"list of celebrities' real names,\" which refers to a concept or information set. These elements align with the category C03 (\"description\"), as they indicate a need for detailed information or a breakdown of the process. Other indicative phrases might include \"explain,\" \"what is,\" or \"how to,\" but here, \"how can i find\" is central to seeking a descriptive response.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question should be classified under C03 (\"description\") because it is fundamentally asking for an explanation or detailed information on how to perform a specific task. Unlike categories that focus on specific facts (e.g., C01 for entities or C04 for numbers), this query requires a descriptive answer that elaborates on the steps involved in finding a list, such as searching online resources, using directories, or understanding privacy aspects. For example, a response might describe how to use Google, IMDb, or other platforms to compile such a list, which involves providing context and instructions rather than a simple fact. This contrasts with other categories: it is not about identifying a particular entity (C01), a person (C02), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). The use of \"how\" emphasizes the procedural and explanatory nature, fitting C03 perfectly.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's focus on seeking a method or explanation aligns clearly with the definition of C03."

    "label": "C01",
    "cot": "\n### Step 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is: \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" This query is seeking information about a specific animal or bird (\"fowl\") that follows the \"Chinese Year of the Monkey\" in the context of the Chinese zodiac. The Chinese zodiac is a 12-year cycle, with each year associated with an animal sign. After the Year of the Monkey, the next year is the Year of the Rooster, so the question is likely referring to the rooster as the fowl that gains prominence or attention. The core request is for a specific entity, which is an object or concept (in this case, a bird), rather than a person, place, number, or explanation.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a specific noun or short phrase identifying the entity in question, such as \"rooster\" or \"chicken,\" based on the zodiac cycle. This indicates a direct, factual response rather than a narrative, definition, or numerical value. The answer format is concise and categorical, focusing on naming or describing a particular thing, which aligns with the characteristics of a question seeking an entity. There is no indication of needing dates, quantities, or descriptive details, so the response is expected to be straightforward and entity-focused.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey phrases in the question include \"fowl,\" which refers to a bird or poultry animal, and \"after the chinese year of the monkey,\" which is a cultural reference to the Chinese zodiac cycle. The phrase \"grabs the spotlight\" is idiomatic for gaining attention or prominence, but it does not change the core inquiry about the entity. Category C01 (\"entity\") is indicated by words like \"fowl,\" which denotes a specific object or concept, and the context of the Chinese zodiac, which involves defining and referencing particular animals as entities. Other categories are less relevant: no human is mentioned, no location or abbreviation is involved, and the question does not ask for a description or numeric value.\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"what fowl grabs the spotlight after the chinese year of the monkey?\" is classified under C01 (\"entity\") because it directly asks for a specific object or concept—the fowl associated with the next year in the Chinese zodiac cycle. In this case, the entity is the rooster, which is a well-defined animal in the zodiac system. The question is not inquiring about a person (C02), as it focuses on an animal, nor is it seeking an explanation or definition (C03), a number or date (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular entity, making C01 the most appropriate category. The cultural context reinforces this, as the Chinese zodiac involves entities like the monkey, rooster, etc., which are specific concepts in the question.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification, as the question explicitly requests a specific entity (the fowl following the Year of the Monkey) and aligns perfectly with the definition of C01, while excluding all other categories based on the question's structure and key phrases."

    "label": "C06",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is \"what is the full form of com ?\". This is a query that seeks the expanded or complete version of the abbreviation \"com\". The core request is to provide the meaning or definition of \"com\", which is likely an acronym or shortened form of a word or phrase. The question type is focused on decoding a shortened expression, indicating a need for clarification or explanation related to a specific linguistic or technical term.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format is descriptive, typically a phrase or sentence that explains what \"com\" stands for, such as \"Computer Organization and Management\" or \"Commercial\" (depending on the context). It is not numerical, as it does not require a number, date, or quantity; nor is it location-based, as it does not ask for a place or spatial information. The answer is likely to be a textual explanation rather than a simple word or data point, emphasizing the need for interpretation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words in the question include \"full form\" and \"com\". \"Full form\" is a common phrase used when asking for the expanded version of an abbreviation or acronym. \"Com\" itself is a short form that could represent various terms (e.g., \"Communications\" in computing or \"Company\" in business), but the question is explicitly about its meaning. These elements align with the C06 category, which is defined for questions seeking the meaning of abbreviations or acronyms. Other potential indicators include phrases like \"what does\" or \"abbreviation for,\" but here \"full form\" is the primary cue.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question \"what is the full form of com ?\" directly falls under the C06 category (abbreviation) because it is inquiring about the meaning of an abbreviated term. Abbreviations are condensed forms of words or phrases, and questions that ask for their \"full form\" are specifically designed to decode or explain these shortened expressions. In this case, \"com\" is likely an acronym (e.g., for \"Communication\" or \"Computer\"), and the query requires a descriptive response that defines it. This contrasts with other categories:  \n- C01 (entity) involves questions about specific objects or concepts, but here the focus is on an abbreviation, not a standalone entity.  \n- C02 (human) relates to people or individuals, which is irrelevant here.  \n- C03 (description) could involve explanations, but the specific phrasing \"full form\" targets abbreviations more precisely.  \n- C04 (numeric) deals with numbers, which is not applicable.  \n- C05 (location) concerns places, which does not fit.  \nThus, the question's intent is to clarify an abbreviation, making C06 the most appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C06  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) in this classification because the question explicitly asks for the full form of \"com\", which is a standard query for abbreviations, and the category description aligns perfectly with seeking the meaning of acronyms or shortened forms."

The information requested is not a simple fact like a date or a location, but rather a conceptual or categorical answer about a type of human occupation. The question implies a search for knowledge about professions in general, with a focus on their historical origins, which suggests an interest in human activities and societal development.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a textual response, such as a noun phrase or a short explanation, e.g., \"farming\" or \"medicine,\" or a brief description like \"the oldest profession is often said to be prostitution, dating back to ancient civilizations.\" This format indicates that the answer is not numerical, locational, or focused on a specific abbreviation. Instead, it involves providing information about a human-centric concept, which could include historical context, definitions, or examples tied to human roles.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"oldest\" and \"profession.\" \"Profession\" is a term that inherently refers to an occupation performed by humans, such as jobs, trades, or roles in society. \"Oldest\" adds a historical dimension, suggesting an inquiry into the origins of human activities. Phrases like \"what is\" are common in questions that seek explanations or identifications, but in this context, they point to human-related information because professions are defined by human behavior, culture, and evolution. There are no indicators of numeric, locational, or abbreviation-focused queries, which helps rule out other categories.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what is the oldest profession?\" should be classified under C02 - human because it fundamentally asks about human occupations and their historical significance. A profession is a concept deeply rooted in human society, involving activities performed by individuals for livelihood, such as farming, teaching, or craftsmanship. The question seeks to identify or describe a profession that is considered the oldest, which inherently ties it to human history, culture, and development. For instance, answering this question might involve discussing how professions emerged from human needs, such as survival, trade, or specialization, making it a human-related inquiry. While the question could be interpreted as seeking a description (C03), the core focus is on the human aspect of professions, as they are not abstract entities but are tied to people's lives. This aligns with the C02 category, which encompasses questions about people, individuals, or human-related information, rather than purely definitional or numerical ones.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the reasoning aligns with the provided correct label and the question's inherent focus on human occupations."

It is not seeking a specific fact like a definition in isolation but rather a comprehensive explanation or breakdown of the concept. The phrase \"what are\" typically indicates a request for descriptive information, such as what something is, how it works, or its significance. This suggests the question is focused on providing detailed knowledge about the topic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive response, likely including a definition, explanation of what liver enzymes are, their roles in the body, and perhaps examples or related details. It is not a simple numerical value, a yes/no answer, or a list of facts; instead, it requires a narrative or explanatory format. This aligns with categories that demand elaboration rather than concise data points.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what are,\" which is a common interrogative for seeking definitions or explanations. The phrase \"liver enzymes\" refers to a biological concept, but the question is not asking for identification of a specific entity (like \"what is liver enzymes?\"), nor is it focused on a person, number, location, or abbreviation. Instead, it prompts for a detailed description, which is indicated by the word \"are\" implying an explanation or definition. This use of language points strongly to the C03 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"what are liver enzymes?\" falls under category C03 (description) because it is asking for an explanation, definition, or detailed information about a concept. Category C03 encompasses questions that seek to describe or elaborate on something, such as providing a definition, explaining mechanisms, or offering contextual details. In this case, the question is not requesting a specific entity (C01), human-related information (C02), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or an abbreviation's meaning (C06).

The core information being sought is the name of a person, which implies a human subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is a proper noun, likely a name or a specific reference to a historical or fictional figure. It should be concise and directly identify the person, such as \"Billy the Kid\" or a similar name. The answer format does not involve numbers, dates, locations, or explanations, but rather a straightforward naming of an individual. This suggests the answer is categorical and human-focused.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey phrases include \"name,\" \"scar faced,\" \"bounty hunter,\" and \"old west.\" The word \"name\" directly indicates a request for an identifier, typically of a person. \"Bounty hunter\" refers to a profession associated with human individuals, and \"scar faced\" describes a physical characteristic, which is often used in narratives to identify specific people. The context \"of the old west\" narrows it to a human-centric theme, such as Western folklore or history, where characters like bounty hunters are central. These elements collectively point to a human-related inquiry.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the name of a specific person—a bounty hunter with a scar from the old west. Bounty hunters are roles typically associated with human individuals, and the description \"scar faced\" further emphasizes a personal, human characteristic. The request to \"name\" this individual means the answer must identify a human being, rather than an object, concept, or place. While \"bounty hunter\" could be seen as an entity, the question's focus on naming a particular one shifts it to human identification. This aligns with the C02 category, which covers questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. It does not fit C01 (entity) because entities are broader concepts or things, not specific people; C03 (description) is incorrect as it involves explaining or detailing, not naming; C04 (numeric) is unrelated to numbers; C05 (location) deals with places; and C06 (abbreviation) involves acronyms, which is not present here.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly targets a specific human individual based on the description and context."

The core request is for a precise piece of data that can be expressed numerically, such as a year or a full date.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer to this question is typically a numerical value, such as a year (e.g., \"1948\") or a date (e.g., \"October 2, 1948\"). This format involves numbers, dates, or measurements, which are quantifiable and often used to specify exact times. The answer does not require subjective interpretation, detailed explanation, or other non-numeric forms; it is straightforward and fact-based.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"when\" and \"born.\" \"When\" is a temporal indicator that often prompts questions about dates, times, or durations, which can be numeric. \"Born\" refers to a specific event with a definable date. These words point to a query that seeks factual, numerical data rather than descriptive, locational, or identity-based information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"when was ozzy osbourne born ?\" directly asks for a birth date, which is a type of measurement or quantity. Dates and years fall under the numeric category (C04) because they involve numerical representations (e.g., day, month, year numbers). While the question references a human (Ozzy Osbourne), the specific focus is on a quantifiable fact about him, not on his identity, life story, or other human-related aspects that would fit under C02. It also does not seek a description, location, or abbreviation, ruling out other categories. The expected answer format reinforces this, as it requires a number or date, aligning with C04's definition of questions asking for numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. Therefore, the classification is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a numerical value (date or year) and matches the category's focus on quantifiable information."

In physics, this question relates to concepts like Newton's second law of motion (F = ma) and the effects of gravity and friction. Heavier objects may accelerate faster downhill due to greater gravitational force, but this depends on factors like the coefficient of friction. The question requires a detailed, descriptive answer that breaks down the reasons, such as how mass influences acceleration, rather than providing a single fact, number, or definition. This contrasts with other categories: C01 (entity) would involve identifying objects, C02 (human) would focus on people, C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, C05 (location) would deal with places, and C06 (abbreviation) would seek meanings of acronyms.

Specifically, it appears to be inquiring about a notable individual associated with the New York Yankees, a well-known baseball team. The phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is idiomatic and commonly used in sports contexts to refer to a star player or a figure of great achievement for the team. Therefore, the information being requested is about a specific human being, likely a famous athlete or historical figure from Yankees history.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as a name, or a brief description of a person. Given the context, the response would probably be a specific individual's name (e.g., \"Babe Ruth\" or \"Mickey Mantle\"), as these are common references in discussions about \"the pride of the Yankees.\" The answer does not require a number, date, definition, or other types of information; it is focused on identifying a human subject. The format suggests a direct identification or reference to a person, rather than an explanation or quantitative data.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"who\" – This is a direct interrogative pronoun that typically signals a question about a person, aligning with the \"human\" category.\n- Key phrases: \"the pride of the yankees\" – This phrase is culturally and contextually linked to human figures in sports, particularly in baseball. It evokes the idea of a prominent individual who embodies pride or excellence for the team, reinforcing the focus on a person rather than an object, concept, or location.\n- \"yankees\" – While this refers to a sports team (an entity), the question is not about the team itself but about \"who\" (a person) was that pride, shifting the focus to human-related information.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"who was the pride of the yankees?\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it explicitly asks for information about a person. The word \"who\" is a strong indicator of a human-focused query, as it seeks to identify or describe an individual. In this case, the phrase \"the pride of the yankees\" is a metaphorical expression that commonly refers to a famous human being, such as Babe Ruth, who is often called \"the Pride of the Yankees.\" This context confirms that the question is not about an object (C01), a concept or definition (C03), a number or measurement (C04), a place (C05), or an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it is centered on human-related information, specifically identifying a person associated with a team. The expected answer, such as a name or brief description, further supports this classification, as it does not involve quantitative data, spatial details, or acronym meanings.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n- Final classification: C02\n- I am highly confident in this classification because the question's structure and key words (\"who\" and idiomatic sports reference) clearly point to a human subject, and the context of \"the pride of the yankees\" is universally understood to refer to a person in this domain."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is \"what is considered the costliest disaster the insurance industry has ever faced?\" This is inquiring about a specific event or occurrence that is recognized as the most expensive disaster in terms of insurance losses. The information being requested is the identification of a particular disaster, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or other catastrophic event, rather than a general discussion or list of disasters. It seeks a named or defined entity that fits the description of being the costliest.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely to be a specific name or description of a disaster, such as \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami,\" which are examples of entities. The answer may include details like the name, date, or type of disaster, but it is not expected to be a numerical value, a definition, or a list. The response should be concise and point to a particular thing, as the question is focused on retrieval or identification rather than explanation or calculation.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"costliest disaster,\" \"insurance industry,\" and \"ever faced.\" \"Disaster\" is central to the query, and it is modified by \"costliest,\" which specifies a particular instance. This language suggests a search for a specific entity, as it implies the existence of a well-known or recognized disaster that meets the criteria. There are no indicators of human involvement, location, abbreviation, or numeric focus, which helps narrow down the category.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific object, concept, or thing—the costliest disaster from the insurance industry's perspective. An entity in this context refers to a distinct and identifiable event, such as a natural disaster, accident, or other insured catastrophe. The question does not seek a general description, definition, or explanation (which would be C03), nor does it ask for a number, date, or quantity (C04). It also does not focus on a person or human element (C02), a geographical place (C05), or an acronym's meaning (C06). Instead, it requires identifying a particular disaster, which is an entity, as it is a specific thing that can be referenced by name or description. For example, the answer might be \"Hurricane Katrina\" or \"The Great East Japan Earthquake,\" both of which are entities in the context of historical events.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C01  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly requests a specific disaster, which aligns with the definition of an entity as a particular thing or concept, and the reasoning steps confirm that no other category fits the query's focus on identification and retrieval."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\nThe question is asking \"what sprawling U.S. state boasts the most airports?\" This is inquiring about a specific U.S. state that possesses a high number of airports, with the adjective \"sprawling\" providing additional descriptive context. The primary information being requested is the identification of a state, which is a type of geographical entity. The question seeks a name or identifier for a location, rather than a definition, explanation, or numerical value in isolation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a state (e.g., \"California\" or \"Texas\"), as the question begins with \"what,\" which typically prompts a categorical or locative response. The answer may implicitly involve a comparison or quantity (e.g., \"California has the most airports\"), but the core output is the state's name, which is a spatial reference. The answer could include a brief explanation or context due to the \"sprawling\" descriptor, but it is fundamentally a locative response. Characteristics include brevity, as it's a direct question for identification, and potential use of geographical terms.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words and phrases include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This explicitly refers to a geographical location within the United States.\n- \"sprawling\": This describes a spatial characteristic, implying size or extent, which is relevant to location-based inquiries.\n- \"boasts the most airports\": This phrase involves a comparison of quantities (e.g., the highest number), but it is subordinate to the identification of the state. It does not directly request a number or date, but rather uses it as context for locating the answer.\n- Overall, the question centers on finding a specific place, with \"location\" being the primary theme.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question should be classified under C05 (location) because it is primarily asking about a geographical area—the U.S. state. The phrase \"U.S. state\" directly invokes a category of location, and the word \"sprawling\" reinforces the spatial aspect by describing the state's physical extent. While the question mentions \"the most airports,\" which could be interpreted as having a numerical component, the core request is for the identification of the state, not the number itself. Category C05 encompasses questions that seek information about places, including their characteristics or comparisons tied to spatial elements. In contrast:\n- C01 (entity) might apply to broader concepts, but here the focus is specifically on a location rather than a general object or idea.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant, as there is no mention of people or human activities.\n- C03 (description) involves explanations or definitions, but this question is not seeking detailed information about airports or states; it's asking for a specific answer.\n- C04 (numeric) could be partially relevant due to the \"most airports\" part, but the question is not primarily about numbers; it's using the numerical aspect to identify a location.\n- C06 (abbreviation) does not apply, as there are no abbreviations in the question.\nThus, the classification aligns with C05 because the question is fundamentally about locating a specific place based on its attributes.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: I am highly confident in this classification because the question's focus on a U.S. state and its spatial characteristics clearly matches the definition of C05, which is for questions about geographical locations."

    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is: \"what did the only repealed amendment to the u s constitution deal with?\" This phrasing indicates a request for information about the content or subject matter of a specific historical amendment. The focus is on explaining what this amendment addressed, rather than identifying it directly or providing a simple fact. The question is not asking for a definition of the amendment itself but rather for a detailed explanation of its provisions, which suggests it is seeking descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer format for this question would likely be a descriptive response, such as a detailed explanation, definition, or historical account. For instance, the answer might describe the amendment's purpose, key provisions, or context, such as prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages. This format involves providing context and elaboration, rather than a short answer like a date, number, or simple identification. The answer should be informative and explanatory in nature, aligning with a non-numerical and non-factual enumeration style.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"what did ... deal with?\" and \"repealed amendment.\" The phrase \"deal with\" is a common indicator for questions seeking descriptions or explanations of topics. Additionally, \"repealed amendment\" refers to a specific historical event, but the question is not focused on identifying the amendment or its number; instead, it asks for its content. This use of language points toward a category that involves explaining or detailing information, which is characteristic of C03 - description. Other categories, like C01 (entity) or C02 (human), might be considered if the question were about a specific object or person, but here the emphasis is on the amendment's subject matter.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question should be classified under C03 - description because it is asking for an explanation or detailed account of what the only repealed amendment dealt with. The 18th Amendment, which was repealed by the 21st Amendment, prohibited the production and sale of alcohol in the United States. The question seeks not just a simple fact (e.g., \"alcohol prohibition\") but a broader description of its implications, historical context, and reasons. This aligns with the C03 category, which covers questions that request explanations, definitions, or detailed information. In contrast, it does not fit C01 (entity) because it's not asking about a specific object or concept in isolation; it's about the content of one. It also doesn't fit C02 (human) as no people are central to the query. Numeric (C04) is irrelevant since no numbers or dates are requested. Location (C05) doesn't apply as the question isn't about a place. Abbreviation (C06) is not relevant because the question isn't inquiring about the meaning of an acronym. The core request for descriptive information, such as what the amendment covered, makes C03 the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C03  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and wording clearly indicate a need for descriptive information, matching the C03 category."

The information being requested is the date, implying a temporal measurement, such as a day, month, and year, or a specific numerical representation of when Boxing Day happens.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n- The expected answer format is likely a date, which could be expressed in various ways, such as \"December 26\" (for Boxing Day in many countries), \"Dec 26,\" or a full date like \"December 26, 2023.\" This format involves numerical elements (e.g., the day number, month abbreviation or name, and optionally the year).\n- Characteristics of the answer: It is quantitative, as it deals with numbers (e.g., the day of the month, month number, or year), and it may include references to calendar systems. The answer is not descriptive or narrative but rather a factual, numerical response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n- Key words: \"date\" – This word is central to the question and directly relates to time or measurement, often involving numbers (e.g., day, month, year).\n- \"boxing day\" – This is a specific entity (C01), but the question is not asking about the entity itself (e.g., its definition or history) but rather about its date. The phrase \"date of\" modifies the query, emphasizing the need for a numerical or temporal answer.\n- Category indicators: The word \"date\" strongly suggests a numeric category, as dates are inherently numerical constructs. Other categories like C03 (description) or C05 (location) do not fit, as the question is not seeking an explanation or a place.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n- The question \"what is the date of boxing day?\" should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it is explicitly asking for a numerical value or measurement related to time. Boxing Day is an event, but the query focuses on its date, which is a specific point in time expressed through numbers. For instance, in many regions, Boxing Day is fixed on December 26, involving the number 26 for the day and 12 for the month (or December). Even if the date varies by country or year, the core request is for a numerical representation, such as a day count or calendar date.\n- This aligns with the definition of C04, which includes questions about numbers, dates, quantities, or measurements. The expected answer format (e.g., a date string with numbers) reinforces this, as it is not about describing the event (C03), identifying a person (C02), specifying a location (C05), or explaining an abbreviation (C06). The word \"date\" acts as a clear indicator, shifting the focus from the entity \"boxing day\" to its temporal aspect, which is inherently numeric.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question directly requests a numerical date, and the analysis confirms it fits the C04 category based on key words, expected answer format, and category definitions."

It asks for \"articles of clothing\" that are used as \"tokens.\" Tokens in Monopoly are the physical or symbolic pieces players use to move around the board, such as the car, dog, or other themed pieces. The request is for identifying particular clothing-related items that serve this purpose, implying a need to list or describe these entities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\n- The expected answer format would likely involve listing specific objects or providing details about the clothing articles that are tokens. For example, in some editions of Monopoly, tokens might include items like a penguin suit (which is clothing-themed) or other representations. The answer could be a list, a set of names, or a brief description, but it should focus on concrete, identifiable entities rather than abstract concepts, numbers, or locations.\n- Characteristics: The response is expected to be informative and specific, drawing from knowledge of the game. It does not require a numerical value, a date, or a geographical location, nor does it involve explaining a concept or acronym.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\n- Key words: \"articles of clothing\" – this phrase refers to specific, tangible items or objects, such as hats, coats, or suits.\n- \"are tokens\" – this indicates a relationship to game elements, but the core is about identifying the entities themselves.\n- \"in monopoly\" – this provides context but does not change the nature of the inquiry; it anchors the question to a specific domain.\n- Category indicators: The question uses \"what\" to request identification of particular things, aligning with the \"entity\" category (C01). There are no words suggesting people (e.g., \"who\"), numbers (e.g., \"how many\"), locations (e.g., \"where\"), or abbreviations (e.g., \"what does X mean\").\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\n- The question falls under category C01 (entity) because it is asking for specific objects or concepts that exist within the game of Monopoly. \"Articles of clothing\" are concrete entities—physical items like clothing pieces—and the question seeks to identify which of these are used as tokens. This involves recognizing and naming particular things, such as \"the penguin suit\" or \"the wheelbarrow\" (though the wheelbarrow might not be clothing, the question might be interpreted broadly or in a specific edition where clothing is involved).\n- To determine this, consider the definition of C01: \"Questions asking about specific objects, concepts, or things.\" Here, the question is focused on identifying particular entities (clothing items) that have a functional role in the game. It is not asking for a description (C03), a number (C04), a location (C05), or an explanation of an acronym (C06). The key phrase \"what articles of clothing\" directly prompts the retrieval of specific entities, making C01 the most appropriate category.\n- For instance, if the answer were \"In some versions of Monopoly, the penguin suit is a token,\" it would still be an entity-based response, as it names a specific object. The question does not require a numerical count or a spatial description, so other categories do not fit.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nI am highly confident that the classification is correct, as the question clearly requests specific objects or things within a defined context, aligning with the C01 category.\n\nFinal classification: C01"

The word \"name\" indicates that the answer should provide the names of these individuals, and \"11 famous martyrs\" specifies the subject matter, which involves people who have been killed or sacrificed for their beliefs, often in historical or religious contexts. This suggests that the question is focused on human beings and their identities.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format is likely a list of names or a set of references to specific human individuals. For example, the response might include names like \"Saint Stephen\" or \"Oscar Romero,\" along with brief context if needed. The answer does not require numerical calculations, descriptive explanations, or spatial details; instead, it demands the identification of people. The inclusion of \"11\" implies a count, but it does not change the core request for human-related information, as the number is simply specifying the quantity of individuals to be named.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"name,\" \"famous,\" and \"martyrs.\" \"Name\" directly relates to identifying entities, but in this context, it is paired with \"martyrs,\" which is a term referring to human individuals who have been persecuted or killed for their beliefs. \"Famous\" further emphasizes that these are well-known people, reinforcing the human aspect. There are no words indicating a focus on objects (like \"entity\"), places (like \"location\"), definitions (like \"description\"), numbers or quantities beyond identification (like \"numeric\"), or abbreviations (like \"abbreviation\"). This points strongly to the human category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"name 11 famous martyrs\" should be classified under category C02 (human) because it is explicitly asking for the identification of specific individuals—martyrs—who are human beings. Category C02 encompasses questions that involve people, their attributes, or human-related information. In this case, the query is not seeking a definition (C03), a numerical value (C04), a geographical location (C05), or the meaning of an abbreviation (C06). Instead, it requires naming human figures, which aligns with the essence of C02. Even though \"martyrs\" can be seen as a concept, it is applied to people, making the question human-centric. The request for \"11\" does not shift the focus to numeric data but rather specifies the number of human individuals to be identified, further supporting the classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C02  \nConfidence: High, as the question directly involves identifying specific human individuals and aligns perfectly with the definition of category C02."

It is primarily seeking a human subject, so the response should be concise and focused on identifying the individual.\n\n### Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nThe key words in the question are \"who,\" \"inventor,\" and \"silly putty.\" \n- \"Who\" is a pronoun that explicitly directs the question toward human beings or individuals.\n- \"Inventor\" is a role or title associated with people, emphasizing human agency and creation.\n- \"Silly putty\" is the object of interest, but it is not the focus; the question is meta, asking about the human behind it.\nThese keywords align with the C02 category, which is defined for questions about people, individuals, or human-related information. In contrast, other categories might be indicated by words like \"what\" (for entities), \"how many\" (for numeric), or \"where\" (for location).\n\n### Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"who was the inventor of silly putty?\" should be classified under C02 (human) because it is fundamentally asking for information about a specific person. The category C02 encompasses questions that inquire about individuals, their roles, or human-related details. In this case:\n- The word \"who\" clearly signals a focus on human identity.\n- \"Inventor\" specifies a human role, as it refers to a person who created something, which falls under human-related information.\n- While \"silly putty\" is an entity (potentially fitting C01), the question is not centered on the object itself but on the human inventor, making it a human-centric query.\n- This contrasts with other categories:\n  - C01 (entity) would apply if the question was about silly putty's properties or definition, e.g., \"what is silly putty?\"\n  - C03 (description) would be for questions seeking detailed explanations, e.g., \"describe the invention of silly putty.\"\n  - C04 (numeric) would involve quantities, e.g., \"how many versions of silly putty exist?\"\n  - C05 (location) would ask about places, e.g., \"where was silly putty invented?\"\n  - C06 (abbreviation) is irrelevant here, as there is no abbreviation involved.\n- Therefore, the question's primary intent is to identify a person, which aligns perfectly with the C02 category's definition of questions asking about people or human-related information.\n\n### Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C02  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question directly uses \"who\" to inquire about a human individual and focuses on a human role (inventor), which is explicitly covered by the C02 category."

This is a request for a specific golf course located in Myrtle Beach. The core information being sought is the name or identity of a particular golf course, which implies the need to identify or specify an entity. The question does not ask for a general explanation, a quantity, a date, or the meaning of an acronym; it directly seeks a named example of a golf course.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun or a specific name, such as \"Myrtle Beach Country Club\" or \"The Links at Myrtle Beach\". This format is concise and direct, focusing on the identification of a single entity. It does not require a numerical value, a descriptive paragraph, a date, or an expanded form of an abbreviation. The answer is expected to be a specific reference to an object or concept, aligning with the characteristics of an entity-based response.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"golf course\", \"name\", and \"in myrtle beach\". \"Golf course\" refers to a specific object or concept, which is a classic example of an entity. \"Name\" indicates the need to identify or specify something, reinforcing the entity category. \"In myrtle beach\" provides contextual information about the location but does not alter the fundamental request for an entity; it simply narrows the scope to a specific area. These elements collectively point to the category C01, as the question is focused on naming or referencing a particular thing.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\nThe question \"name a golf course in myrtle beach\" should be classified under C01 (entity) because it is asking for a specific golf course, which is an instance of an entity. An entity category encompasses questions that seek information about particular objects, concepts, or things, such as names of places, items, or organizations. In this case, \"golf course\" is a concrete object, and the phrase \"name a\" directs the response to provide a specific example, like a proper noun. This contrasts with other categories: it is not a description (e.g., asking \"what is a golf course?\"), not numeric (e.g., \"how many golf courses are in Myrtle Beach?\"), not location (e.g., asking about Myrtle Beach itself), and not abbreviation (e.g., \"what does GC stand for?\"). The focus on identifying a golf course as a distinct entity makes C01 the appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\nFinal classification: C01  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question explicitly requests a specific golf course, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an entity category."

The core request is for geographical information, focusing on the spatial relationship between the bay and the states that enclose it. The question seeks to identify the boundaries or adjacent areas of a particular location.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing two state names, such as \"Maryland and Virginia,\" which are proper nouns referring to political entities. The answer is not expected to be a definition, a numerical value, or a detailed explanation. Instead, it should be concise and directly address the spatial aspect of the query. The characteristics of the answer include being specific to geography and involving the identification of locations that are directly related to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words and phrases in the question include \"states,\" \"enclose,\" and \"chesapeake bay.\" \"Chesapeake Bay\" is a proper noun that refers to a well-known geographical feature, indicating a location. \"States\" refers to political divisions, but in this context, it is part of the spatial inquiry. \"Enclose\" implies a spatial or geographical relationship, such as boundaries or surrounding areas. These elements point toward a question focused on places or spatial information, aligning with the C05 category.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThe question \"which two states enclose chesapeake bay ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it directly asks about geographical locations and their spatial relationships. The Chesapeake Bay is a specific place, and the query seeks information about the states that border it, which involves identifying spatial enclosures. This fits the C05 category description of \"Questions asking about places, geographical locations, or spatial information.\" In contrast, it does not fall under C01 (entity) because while states are entities, the focus here is on their role in relation to a location, not the entities themselves. It is not C02 (human) as no people or human elements are involved. It excludes C03 (description) because the answer does not require an explanation or definition. It is not C04 (numeric) since no numbers or measurements are requested, and it is not C06 (abbreviation) as there is no mention of abbreviations. The question is purely spatial, making C05 the most appropriate classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C05  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly focuses on geographical locations and spatial information, which is the core of the C05 category, and the reasoning aligns with the provided category descriptions."

The core request is for a specific numerical value, indicating that the user is seeking a count or measurement rather than a description, definition, or other type of information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question is asking for a \"number\" of points. For example, a typical response might be a specific integer, such as \"300\" for standard bowling, but in this case, it's tailored to fivepin bowling. The answer should be a precise quantity, possibly with units (e.g., \"300 points\"), and it should not involve descriptive text, dates, or other non-numeric elements. The characteristics of the expected answer include being quantifiable and measurable, aligning with the definition of a numeric question.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"points,\" and \"perfect fivepin bowling score.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a direct indicator of a request for a quantity or count, which is central to numeric questions. \"Points\" refers to a unit of measurement in scoring, often numerical in nature. The context \"perfect fivepin bowling score\" provides background but does not change the fundamental request for a number. Other categories, such as description or entity, might involve explaining what points are or what a score entails, but this question is explicitly asking for a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it directly asks for a specific numerical value. The word \"how many\" is a strong signal that the user is seeking a quantity, and the subject matter (points in bowling) is inherently numerical, as scores are measured in discrete units. This is not a question about an entity (e.g., \"What is a fivepin bowling score?\"), a human (e.g., \"Who invented fivepin bowling?\"), a description (e.g., \"Explain how fivepin bowling works?\"), a location (e.g., \"Where is fivepin bowling played?\"), or an abbreviation (e.g., \"What does PIN stand for in bowling?\"). Instead, it requires a number, making C04 the appropriate classification. The context of a \"perfect score\" implies a fixed or standard quantity, further supporting the numeric nature of the question.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C04  \nConfidence: I am highly confident (95%) that this classification is correct, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a request for a numerical answer."

The request is for information about an entity (a company) that meets certain criteria, but the way it's phrased implies a need to provide more than just a simple name; it requires contextual or descriptive details to pinpoint the correct company.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely to be the name of a company, such as \"Nintendo\" or \"Sega\", but it may also include a brief explanation or context to justify why that company is the one that sells the \"super system\". For instance, the answer might involve describing the company's role in video game hardware manufacturing and its product lineup. The answer format could be a sentence or phrase that provides a complete response, rather than just a list or a number, indicating that descriptive elements are part of the expected output.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nKey words include \"which company\", \"manufactures\", \"sells\", and \"super system\". These phrases suggest a focus on identifying an organization (an entity) but also imply that the answer requires specifying which one based on its actions and products. The term \"super system\" might refer to a specific product like the Super Nintendo or similar, and the question is framed to seek detailed information about the company in relation to this product, rather than just a direct reference to an object or a numerical value.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question is classified under C02 (description) because it is not primarily asking for a simple identification of an entity (like C01) or a numerical value (like C04).

The core request is for a number, indicating that the answer will be a digit or a numerical expression, rather than a descriptive or categorical response.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is numerical, as the question uses the phrase \"how many,\" which typically elicits a response like a specific number (e.g., \"There are 16 Community Chest cards in Monopoly\"). The answer may include a brief context or confirmation, but it must primarily be a quantity. Characteristics include: it could be a fixed number (e.g., from game rules), a date (though unlikely here), or a measurement (e.g., count).

The request is not for a specific fact, such as a definition of \"Mormon\" or a list of members, but rather for an explanation or detailed account of what they hold as true. This indicates that the question is seeking interpretive or descriptive information about a concept or belief system.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format involves providing a detailed explanation, such as a breakdown of key beliefs (e.g., the nature of God, salvation through Jesus Christ, the role of scripture, or end-times prophecies). The response should be explanatory and may include definitions or elaborations on concepts, rather than a simple fact, number, or location. For instance, an answer might describe Mormon theology in depth, which aligns with the need for descriptive content.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nKey words in the question include \"what do mormons believe\", where \"believe\" is a central phrase that signals an inquiry into opinions, doctrines, or explanatory information. \"Mormons\" refers to a religious entity, but the question is not focused on identifying or describing the entity itself (which would be entity-related) but on what they believe, which emphasizes the need for descriptive details.

The core request is for a numerical value or count, indicating that the user wants to know the exact or approximate number of people associated with this linguistic group. This suggests the question is seeking factual, statistical information rather than subjective or descriptive details.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**  \nThe expected answer format for this question is likely a numerical response, such as a specific number (e.g., \"Approximately 300 million\"), a range (e.g., \"Between 100 and 400 million\"), or a reference to a data source. The characteristics of the answer are quantitative, meaning it deals with measurements, counts, or numerical data. It does not require a narrative, definition, or qualitative explanation, but rather a direct or indirect numerical output.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**  \nThe key words and phrases in the question include \"how many,\" \"people,\" and \"speak french.\" The phrase \"how many\" is a strong indicator of a request for a quantity or numerical value. \"People\" refers to a human group, but in this context, it is part of the count being sought. \"Speak french\" specifies the subject of the count, but the focus is on the numerical aspect. These elements align with the C04 category, which is defined by questions seeking numbers, dates, or measurements.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**  \nThis question should be classified under C04 (numeric) because it explicitly asks for a numerical quantity—the number of people who speak French worldwide. The use of \"how many\" directly points to a request for a count or measurement, which is a hallmark of the numeric category. Unlike C01 (entity), which would involve questions about the nature or identity of something (e.g., \"What is French?\"), this question is not seeking a definition or conceptual explanation. It also differs from C02 (human), which focuses on individuals or human-related topics without necessarily requiring a number (e.g., \"Who is the president of France?\"). There is no element of description, location, or abbreviation here; the question is purely quantitative. The expected answer is a number, not a descriptive paragraph or geographical reference, further confirming the C04 classification.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**  \nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question unambiguously seeks a numerical answer, matching the core definition of the C04 category."

It is not asking for general information about the statue, but rather a precise measurement in inches that exceeds six feet. The core request is for a quantity, which indicates a focus on numerical data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer should be a numerical value, such as a number followed by a unit (e.g., \"X inches\"), where X represents the exact measurement. This suggests that the answer is quantitative and does not require descriptive, qualitative, or categorical information. The question implies a calculation or direct retrieval of a number, as it involves a comparison (over six feet) and a specific unit (inches).\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"how many inches\" and \"over six feet.\" These phrases explicitly reference units of measurement and a request for a count or quantity. \"Inches\" and \"feet\" are standard units for measuring length, which are commonly associated with numeric questions. There are no words indicating a need for descriptive, locational, or human-related information, further supporting a numeric focus.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question falls under category C04 (numeric) because it is fundamentally asking for a numerical answer involving a measurement. It seeks the exact number of inches that the Venus de Milo statue exceeds six feet by, which requires a specific quantity. This is not a question about an entity (C01), as it's not inquiring about the statue itself in a general sense; not about a human (C02), as it doesn't involve people; not about a description (C03), as it doesn't ask for an explanation or definition; not about a location (C05), as it's not concerned with places; and not about an abbreviation (C06), as it doesn't involve acronyms or short forms. The presence of measurement units and the direct request for a number confirm the numeric classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C04  \nI am highly confident in this classification because the question explicitly demands a numerical response, aligning perfectly with the definition of C04."

This type of question focuses on understanding the concept deeply, rather than identifying a particular object, person, number, place, or acronym.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question would be a descriptive, explanatory, or definitional response. It could involve providing a detailed explanation, such as breaking down learning into components (e.g., cognitive processes, behavioral changes), referencing educational theories (e.g., constructivism or behaviorism), or offering examples to illustrate the nature of learning. The answer format is likely to be textual and narrative, emphasizing depth and clarity, rather than being numerical, concise, or factual in a simple way.

The phrasing is informal (\"u s state\" likely means \"U.S. state\") and uses \"lived under six flags,\" which may refer to a state's history of being governed by multiple entities, such as European powers or other influences. The core request is to identify a particular state within the United States that fits this criterion. This suggests the question is focused on retrieving a named entity with a geographical and historical context.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.**\n\nThe expected answer format is likely a proper noun, specifically the name of a U.S. state (e.g., \"Georgia\" or \"Louisiana\"), as the question begins with \"what U.S. state.\" The answer should be concise and directly identify a location, rather than providing a detailed explanation, definition, or numerical data. The characteristics of the response include being a specific, named place with historical significance, but the primary output is the identification of the state itself, not the description of its history.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.**\n\nKey words and phrases in the question include:\n- \"U.S. state\": This directly refers to a specific entity within the United States, emphasizing a geographical or political boundary.\n- \"lived under six flags\": This phrase introduces a historical or descriptive element, but it is tied to the state's location and its past associations with different flags, which are symbolic representations of control or sovereignty over a place.\n- Overall, the question is inquiring about a place with a particular attribute, but the attribute (\"lived under six flags\") does not change the fundamental request for a location.\n\nThese elements align with categories that deal with places, objects, or concepts. The word \"state\" here is not just any entity but specifically a political division within a country, which is inherently geographical.\n\n**Step 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.**\n\nThe question should be classified under category C05 (location) because it is primarily asking for information about a specific geographical area within the United States. The phrase \"U.S. state\" explicitly indicates a location, as U.S. states are defined by their boundaries and are part of the geographical landscape. The additional phrase \"lived under six flags\" adds a historical context, but it does not shift the question away from seeking a place; instead, it specifies a characteristic of that location. \n\n- **Comparison with other categories:**\n  - C01 (entity): While a U.S. state can be considered an entity, the category description focuses on \"specific objects, concepts, or things,\" but in this case, the state is being treated as a location rather than a general concept. The question is not about the state as an abstract idea but as a physical and historical place.\n  - C02 (human): This category involves people or human-related information, which is irrelevant here as the question is not about individuals.\n  - C03 (description): This would involve explaining or defining something, but the question is asking for a specific answer (a state name), not a detailed explanation.\n  - C04 (numeric): This requires numbers or quantities, but the question does not ask for a count or measurement; it seeks a named entity.\n  - C06 (abbreviation): This deals with meanings of abbreviations, which is not applicable as the question is not about decoding acronyms.\n\nThe core of the question is to identify a U.S. state, which is a type of location, making C05 the most appropriate category. The historical aspect (\"lived under six flags\") is secondary and does not override the primary focus on the geographical entity.\n\n**Step 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.**\n\nFinal classification: C05\n\nConfidence: High, as the question unambiguously asks for a specific U.S. state, which falls under the location category, and the historical detail does not alter this classification."

This indicates that the user is seeking spatial or geographical information, such as a specific place, address, or coordinates. The information being requested is not about an identity or definition but rather about the physical or conceptual location of the subject.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\nThe expected answer for this question would likely be a location-based response, such as a place name, address, or descriptive spatial information. For example, answers might include a city, street, landmark, or coordinates. The format is typically concise and factual, focusing on providing a clear position rather than a narrative or numerical value. Characteristics include the use of geographical terms or references, and the answer should directly address the \"where\" aspect without delving into other details like descriptions or definitions.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\nKey words in the question include \"where\", which is a strong indicator of location-related inquiries. The phrase \"where is\" is a common interrogative structure used to ask for spatial information. The term \"loop\" is ambiguous and could refer to various concepts (e.g., a programming construct, a physical object, or a geographical feature), but the word \"where\" specifies that the focus is on its location. This aligns with the C05 category, which is defined by questions about places or spatial information, rather than entities, descriptions, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\nThe question \"where is the loop ?\" should be classified under C05 (location) because it explicitly asks for the position or place of \"the loop\". The word \"where\" is a direct cue for location-based queries, and the structure of the question implies a request for geographical or spatial data. For instance, if \"loop\" refers to a physical loop (e.g., in a park or road), the answer would involve its location; if it's metaphorical, it still seeks where it exists or is situated. This contrasts with other categories:\n- C01 (entity) would involve asking what \"loop\" is, not its location.\n- C02 (human) is irrelevant as there's no reference to people.\n- C03 (description) would require a detailed explanation, but this question is focused on a specific place.\n- C04 (numeric) would ask for numbers, which isn't the case here.\n- C06 (abbreviation) would involve decoding an acronym, but \"loop\" isn't an abbreviation.\nThe key phrase \"where is\" reinforces the location intent, and the absence of other cues (like \"who\", \"what\", or \"define\") confirms that C05 is the appropriate classification.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High confidence, as the question's structure and keywords unambiguously point to a location inquiry, with no conflicting indicators from other categories."

    "text": "what country ' s capital is tirana ?",
    "label": "C05",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.  \nThe question is asking for the country that has Tirana as its capital. It involves geographical information, specifically inquiring about a capital city and the associated country. The core request is to identify a place or location.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.  \nThe expected answer is likely a proper noun, such as the name of a country (e.g., \"Albania\"), which is a specific entity related to a geographical area. The answer format is concise, typically a single word or short phrase, and does not require numerical data, definitions, or explanations.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.  \nThe key words are \"country\", \"capital\", and \"is tirana\". \"Capital\" refers to a city, which is a defined location, and \"country\" is a nation, also a location. The phrase \"what country's capital\" emphasizes a spatial relationship, pointing to a geographical query. There are no indicators of a person, definition, number, or abbreviation.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.  \nThe question falls under category C05 (location) because it is seeking information about a geographical place. Specifically, it asks for the country whose capital is Tirana, which involves identifying a location (the country) based on its capital city. This aligns with the category description for location, which includes questions about places, spatial information, or geographical entities. The question does not request a description, numeric value, or abbreviation, but rather focuses on a specific location.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.  \nFinal classification: C05  \nConfidence: High, as the question clearly involves geographical location information, matching the definition of C05."

    "text": "what is titanium ?",
    "label": "C03",
    "cot": "\nStep 1: Identify the question type and what information is being requested.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" is an interrogative phrase that directly asks for an explanation or definition of the term \"titanium.\" Titanium is a specific chemical element, and the question is requesting detailed information about its nature, properties, history, or other descriptive aspects. This indicates that the question is not seeking a simple identification or classification but rather a comprehensive explanation, which aligns with the need for descriptive information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the expected answer format and characteristics.\n\nThe expected answer for this question is likely to be a detailed, explanatory response, such as a definition, description of characteristics, historical context, or examples of uses. It would not be a short, factual statement or a single piece of data. For instance, a typical answer might include details like \"Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22, known for its strength, low density, and corrosion resistance.\" This format emphasizes explanation and detail, rather than a numerical value, a location, or a concise definition alone. The characteristics of the expected answer are descriptive, informative, and multi-faceted, fitting the nature of a \"description\" query.\n\nStep 3: Consider the key words and phrases that indicate the question category.\n\nThe key words in the question are \"what is,\" which is a common phrase used to request definitions or explanations. Additionally, \"titanium\" refers to a specific entity (a chemical element), but the question is not focused on identifying it as an entity (C01) or asking about a human-related aspect (C02). There are no indicators of a numeric response (e.g., no mention of numbers or dates), location (e.g., no reference to places), or abbreviation (e.g., no acronym or shortened form). The phrase \"what is\" strongly suggests a request for descriptive information, as it prompts an explanation rather than a simple fact retrieval.\n\nStep 4: Explain in detail why the question should be classified under the given category.\n\nThe question \"what is titanium ?\" should be classified under category C03 (description) because it explicitly seeks an explanation or definition of titanium, which involves providing detailed information about the subject. Titanium is a chemical element, but the question is not asking for it as an entity (C01), which would focus on its classification or identity, nor is it human-related (C02), numeric (C04), location-based (C05), or abbreviation-focused (C06). Instead, the core intent is to understand what titanium is, implying a need for descriptive content such as its atomic properties, discovery, applications, and significance. This matches the category description for C03, which includes questions that ask for explanations, definitions, or detailed information. The expected answer format, as analyzed in Step 2, is descriptive and explanatory, further supporting this classification. Therefore, based on the question's structure and content, C03 is the appropriate category.\n\nStep 5: State your final classification with a confidence statement.\n\nFinal classification: C03\n\nI am highly confident that this classification is correct, as the question's wording and intent align closely with the definition and characteristics of category C03."
