    " resolutio\n\nTranslation: The West German Institute is calling for an early tax cut to stimulate the economy and growth. The institute's joint spring report predicts a 2% expansion and 2% growth in the gross national product, which grew by 2% last year. The institute believes that productive growth can create additional jobs. The institute is calling for the government to bring forward the tax reform plan, which will provide a gross tax reduction of 10 billion marks. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 5 billion marks. The institute criticizes the government for not having left open the question of financing the tax reduction package, which will be paid for by cuts in state subsidies. The lack of clarity in Bonn has caused uncertainty among companies and households exactly as to how they will receive the tax reform and is urging a quick resolution.\n\nCategory: C17 - interest",

    " accord may not produc satisfactori result if goverment not impliment policy recomendation of group financ minist and central banker\n\nTranslation: \nLawson, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that the Louvre agreement was satisfactory. The Louvre agreement was an agreement between the finance ministers and central bankers to stabilize the currency and strengthen the economy. The summit in Venice in June was a preview of the summit that was expected to produce major economic initiatives. Lawson said that the work of the group would remain in improving the conditions for the last world economic growth. He also said that there was scope for reducing interest rates, as indicated by the Japanese interest rate. Lawson also said that he would embark on a gradual reduction of the fiscal deficit over the next two years. The Louvre accord had produced a satisfactory exchange rate stabilization, part of which was a heavy coordination of intervention by the group of central banks and the content of the sterling exchange rate. Today, the currency reserves announced a record billion pound rise. Lawson also said that he risked that the Louvre accord may not produce a satisfactory result if the government does not implement the policy recommendations of the group of finance ministers and central bankers.\n\nClassification: C18 - money-fx",
