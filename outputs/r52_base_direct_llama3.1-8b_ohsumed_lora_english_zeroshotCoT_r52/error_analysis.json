The operating loss is due to expenses for research and development. This suggests that the company is investing heavily in research and development, which is a common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. The text also mentions the sale of a drug called Tagamet, which is a well-known ulcer treatment drug. This further supports the classification as C24 - ipi, as the drug is likely to be imported and its price would be an important factor in the import price index.\n\nI agree with your classification."

The institute's joint spring report predicts a 2% expansion and 2% growth in the gross national product, which grew by 2% last year. The institute believes that productive growth can create additional jobs. The institute is calling for the government to bring forward the tax reform plan, which will provide a gross tax reduction of 10 billion marks. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 5 billion marks. The institute criticizes the government for not having left open the question of financing the tax reduction package, which will be paid for by cuts in state subsidies. The lack of clarity in Bonn has caused uncertainty among companies and households exactly as to how they will receive the tax reform and is urging a quick resolution.\n\nCategory: C17 - interest"

If the text is about coffee, the category would be C07.\n\nThis news article is about the European Union's agricultural policies and the COPA (Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations in the European Union) and its president, Kjeldsen. The article mentions the COPA's concerns about the EU's agricultural policies, specifically the tax on vegetable protein, oil, and fat. The article also mentions the COPA's proposal to restrict the import of oil and fat, and the EU's commissioner's proposal to fix the annual price of these products.\n\nBased on the content of the news article, I would classify it under the category C13 - grain."

The text also mentions \"Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz\" which is a person from the Middle East. The text also mentions \"Iranian oil platform\" and \"Kuwait\" which are also related to the Middle East. The text also mentions \"United States\" which is a country that has a significant impact on the global money market. Therefore, the text is related to money-fx (foreign exchange) because it involves international relations between the Middle East and the United States.\n\nHowever, I may be wrong, and I would like to verify my classification.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, I have found that the text does not explicitly mention any economic indicators or financial data that are typically associated with money-fx.
