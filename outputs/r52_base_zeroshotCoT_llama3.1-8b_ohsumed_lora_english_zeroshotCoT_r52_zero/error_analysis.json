The institute's joint spring report predicts a 2% expansion and 2% growth in the gross national product, which grew by 2% last year. The institute believes that productive growth can create additional jobs. The institute is calling for the government to bring forward the tax reform plan, which will provide a gross tax reduction of 10 billion marks. The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 5 billion marks. The institute criticizes the government for not having left open the question of financing the tax reduction package, which will be paid for by cuts in state subsidies. The lack of clarity in Bonn has caused uncertainty among companies and households exactly as to how they will receive the tax reform and is urging a quick resolution.\n\nCategory: C17 - interest"
