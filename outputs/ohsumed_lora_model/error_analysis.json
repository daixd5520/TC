Instead, it focuses on the treatment of patients with massive burns who are undergoing organ transplantation.\n\nConsidering the broader context, the text is more closely related to the treatment of patients with massive burns and the use of immunosuppressants to prevent organ rejection.

The subject is a \"guinea pig,\" which is an animal.\n\nConsidering these points, the text is related to the use of a radioactive substance in an animal, specifically for medical imaging purposes. This suggests that the text is related to the study of diseases or conditions in animals, which is not directly related to human diseases.\n\nBased on the category mapping provided, the closest match for this description is:\n\nC22 - Animal Diseases\n\nThis classification is based on the fact that the text involves an animal (guinea pig) and a medical imaging technique."
