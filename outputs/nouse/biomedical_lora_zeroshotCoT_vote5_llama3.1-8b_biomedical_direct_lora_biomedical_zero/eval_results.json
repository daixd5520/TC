However, since the text specifically mentions rats and the effect of prolonged isolation, it's not directly related to the sympathetic nervous system or norepinephrine but rather an experimental setup.\n\nGiven this information, the closest category that matches the context of the text would be C18 - mathematics, as the experiment involves an animal model (rats) and the effect of a specific condition (prolonged isolation) on their response to a substance (isoprenaline). However, this seems to be an unusual choice, as the text is more likely related to biology or pharmacology.\n\nA more suitable choice would be C02 - chemistry, as the text involves a chemical compound (isoprenaline) and its effect on rats.",
