This approach is related to the treatment of certain diseases or conditions. While it is not a disease itself, it does indicate that the patient is undergoing some form of medical treatment.\n\nGiven that the primary mention of \"Massive splenomegaly\" points towards a neoplasm, I would keep the classification as:\n\nC04 - Neoplasms"

So we can directly classify it based on the location mentioned as:\n \n Given the above analysis, the text \"Pathogenesis and therapy of peptic ulcer disease\" belongs to C06 - Digestive System Diseases."
